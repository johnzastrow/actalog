"Wednesday 250910","4 rounds for time of:  
10 triple-unders  
20 chest-to-bar pull-ups   
30 wall-balls shots


♀ 14-lb medicine ball to a 9-foot target  
♂ 20-lb medicine ball to a 10-foot target


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a combination of skills. The triple-under is meant to be the higher-skill challenge, so choose a movement that allows you to focus on a skill before moving on to the lower-skill exercises. For the pull-ups, choose an option that allows you to maintain consistent sets of 5 reps. The wall-ball shots are meant to be completed in larger chunks, and the easiest of the three movements.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps of each movement. Reduce the loading of the medicine ball. 
 
To reduce the complexity of triple-unders, consider double-unders or single-unders. Other variations may also be practiced; for example, crossovers, or one-foot single-unders or double-unders. For the chest-to-bar pull-ups, reduce the range of motion to chin-over-bar pull-ups or jumping pull-ups. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the triple-unders, perform penguin taps. For the chest-to-bar pull-ups, perform ring rows. For the wall-ball shots, perform medicine-ball front squats for an overhead limitation, or medicine-ball push presses for a squatting limitation. 
 
**Intermediate option:**    
4 rounds for time of:  
10 **single-leg double-unders**  
20 **pull-ups**   
30 wall-balls shots


♀ **10**-lb medicine ball to a 9-foot target  
♂ **14**-lb medicine ball to a 10-foot target


**Beginner option:**   
**3** rounds for time of:  
10 **single**-unders  
**15 ring rows**   
**20** wall-balls shots 
 

♀ **6**-lb medicine ball to a 9-foot target  
♂ **10**-lb medicine ball to a 10-foot target


**Coaching cues:**  
For the triple-unders, spin fast from the wrists, not the shoulders — stay tall and punch your toes down as you jump.

"Tuesday 250909","Every minute on the minute, alternating, for 12 minutes, complete:  
Odd minutes: 10 unbroken deadlifts  
Even minutes: 7 shuttle runs (25 feet out and 25 feet back)


Choose your load for the deadlift.


Post loads of the deadlifts to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is an opportunity to go heavy with an elevated heart rate. The loading on the barbell is completely up to you — the only caveat is that each set of 10 needs to be unbroken. You can choose to stick with one weight for all sets or increase the loading across as many sets as possible.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps of both the deadlift and shuttle runs. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the deadlifts, perform sumo deadlifts. This will allow you to maintain a more upright position and eliminate the need to navigate the knees. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the deadlifts, reduce the range of motion by elevating the barbell off the ground or perform kettlebell sumo deadlifts. For the shuttle runs, perform 7-10 calories on any machine (about 30 seconds of effort). 
 
**Intermediate option:**  
Every minute on the minute, alternating, for 12 minutes, complete:  
Odd minutes: 10 unbroken deadlifts

**Coaching cues:**  
When cycling deadlifts, focus on initiating the descent of each rep by pushing the hips back so the bar path is moving in a straight line down.

10 AbMat sit-ups  


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a midline clash. Expect the two movements to interfere with each other, and the accumulation of volume will make this effort more challenging. With that in mind, choose an option for the handstand hold that allows you to consistently hold for 20 seconds or more. The prescribed variation of the handstand should be completed with your back to the wall.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the time of the handstand holds and the reps of the AbMat sit-ups. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the handstand holds, perform pike holds with your feet on a box or with your feet on the ground.
In case of injury or limitation, for the handstand holds, perform plank holds. For the AbMat sit-ups, perform feet-anchored sit-ups.

25 power snatches  
25-calorie Echo bike  
25 power snatches  
25-calorie Echo bike  
25 power snatches  


♀ 55-lb barbell  
♂ 75-lb barbell


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a play on the classic Hero workout Randy. Attack this effort just as you would any Hero workout. You should sprint right from the start — complete as many touch-and-go snatches as you can, and race through the calories on the bike. Don’t try to game the workout or pace it. Push the pedal to the floor and hang on. The loading of the barbell is light, so make sure you choose a weight with which you can perform 1 or 2 sets of 15 unbroken reps.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the barbell. Reduce the reps of the snatches and the calories on the bike. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the power snatches, consider hang power snatches or muscle snatches. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the power snatches, perform dumbbell snatches or consider power cleans if there is an overhead limitation. For the bike, substitute any machine you have available. If you have no machines, perform 12 50-foot shuttle runs (25 feet out and 25 feet back).

**Coaching cues:**  
On the return of the barbell on the power snatches, remember to pull your chest up and lower your hips as you lower the barbell to the ground. As you fatigue, avoid bending at the hips and rounding your back.

"Friday 250905","3 rounds for time of:  
10 ring muscle-ups  
20 alternating weighted single-leg squats  
400-meter run


♀ 20-lb dumbbell  
♂ 35-lb dumbbell


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today's workout is a triplet that combines higher-skill elements with a monostructural movement. The weighted single-leg squat presents a slightly greater challenge compared to the unloaded variation; however, using the weight as a counterbalance may allow for better torso positioning during the movement. With that said, if you have not “mastered” the basic single-leg squat, do not attempt to add weight in today’s workout. Get in some practice with the weighted variation prior to the workout, but when it is go time, perform the movement unloaded. For the ring muscle-ups, choose an option that allows you to complete your reps in 2 minutes or less each round. On the run, push the pace if your “wobbly” legs let you.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the dumbbell. Reduce the reps of the ring muscle-ups and single-leg squats. Reduce the distance of the run. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the ring muscle-ups, perform jumping muscle-ups or a low-ring transition. For the weighted single-leg squats, perform these with no weight. You may also consider single-leg squats with your non-squatting foot wrapped around the heel of your squatting foot. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the run, complete 900/1,250 meters on the Echo bike, or 400/500 meters on the rower or ski erg. For the single-leg squats, consider a reverse lunge or an air squat. For the ring muscle-ups, consider a ring row + a push-up. 
 
**Intermediate option:**  
3 rounds for time of:  
**5 jumping** muscle-ups  
20 alternating **single-leg squats**  
400-meter run


**Beginner option:**   
3 rounds for time of:  
**5 low-ring muscle-up transitions**  
20 alternating **reverse lunges**  
**200**-meter run  


**Coaching cues:**  
When performing muscle-ups, avoid dropping straight down from the rings after a successful rep. This will break your kip rhythm and prevent you from stringing reps together. Instead, press away from the rings at the top, counterbalancing with your toes in front of the rings, before moving into the kip for your next rep.

"Wednesday 250903","Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 10 minutes of:  
5 toes-to-bars  
3 sandbag over-the-shoulders  
1 wall walk

♀ 100-lb sandbag  
♂ 150-lb sandbag


Post rounds and reps to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Each set of today’s workout contains a low volume of reps to allow you to cycle through quick rounds. Choose an option for the toes-to-bars that allows you to maintain unbroken reps for the entire workout. The loading of the sandbag should allow you to complete your reps in around 30 seconds. Your goal should be to complete 6 rounds or more. More-advanced athletes may be able to perform a single round in under a minute and hold that pace for the entire workout.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the sandbag.

To reduce the complexity of the toes-to-bars, reduce the range of motion by bringing the knees to the chest or a consistent height on the body. For the wall walks, reduce the range of motion by walking your hands only a few steps toward the wall.

In case of injury or limitation, perform power cleans with a single dumbbell or barbell instead of sandbag over-the-shoulders. Perform V-ups or sit-ups in place of the toes-to-bars, and inchworms with a push-up in place of the wall walks.
   
**Intermediate option:**  
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 10 minutes of:

3 **single-arm dumbbell power cleans**  
1 **inchworm + push-up from the knees**


Switch arms on the cleans as needed.

♀ **25**-lb dumbbell  
♂ **35**-lb dumbbell


**Coaching cues:**  
When pulling the sandbag off the ground, get your hands underneath the bag and squat down as low as possible. Lift the bag to your thighs, bear-hug it, then with the bag held tight to your chest, extend your hips and legs aggressively, and throw the bag over your shoulder.

Box jump-overs


♀ 105-lb barbell and a 24-inch box  
♂ 155-lb barbell and a 30-inch box


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout contains two movements that seemingly have nothing to do with one another. However, bench pressing is more challenging when out of breath — expect the box jump-overs to throw a wrench into today’s effort. Use a weight for the bench presses that allows you to perform consistent sets of 5 reps or more. On the box jump-overs, manage your pace based on your capacity on the bench. If you do not have a spotter available, do not push to failure on the bench presses. Stick with a rep scheme you can manage and stay safe.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the barbell. Reduce the reps of each movement. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the bench presses, consider using a pair of dumbbells instead of the barbell. For the box jump-overs, reduce the height of the box as low as necessary to maintain the jumping stimulus of the movement. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the bench presses, consider dumbbell floor presses, weighted push-ups, or unloaded push-ups. For the box jump-overs, consider box step-overs.

"Monday 250901","Every minute on the minute for 12 minutes, complete:  
3 front squats


Score is total load lifted. 


Post loads to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is an opportunity to lift a heavy load relative to your capacity. Athletes who know their best front squat should aim to start this workout at about 60%,  then increase the loading across as many sets as possible. Advanced athletes should consider sticking with a challenging weight and holding across all 12 sets. Newer athletes should focus on developing consistently sound mechanics before adding weight. After completing the 3 reps, rack the barbell and rest with the remaining time.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the front squat, consider adjusting your grip on the barbell. You could try resting the barbell on the shoulders and placing your hands on opposite shoulders, or using straps to eliminate the difficulty of the rack position. Another option is to use a pair of dumbbells. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, consider performing a back squat or a dumbbell goblet squat. 
 
**Intermediate option:**  
Same as Rx’d.


**Beginner option:**   
Same as Rx’d.


**Coaching cues:**  
In the front squat, find a target to drive your elbows toward as you are completing your reps. This target should be above your neutral gaze and challenge you to keep your triceps parallel to the ground.

[The Quiet (CrossFit) Professional: When External Motivation Fails](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-quiet-professional)


When the music fades and motivational slogans fall silent, CrossFit reveals its most precious gift: the opportunity to discover who you really are in ""that dark place"" where only internal guts, will, and courage can carry you forward. Like the elite warriors known as ""quiet professionals,"" true growth happens not through external hype, but in those solitary moments when you must choose between quitting and pushing through the pain. This is where CrossFit transforms from mere exercise into a daily battle with yourself — and where real character is forged one rep at a time.

20 lateral burpees over the dumbbell  
20 alternating dumbbell hang clean-to-overheads  
200-meter row


♀ 35-lb dumbbell  
♂ 50-lb dumbbell


Post rounds and reps to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a grind. Move at a consistent pace and aim to complete at least 4 rounds. The loading of the dumbbell should allow you to complete your reps in 2 sets or less in each round. If you need a place to slow down and recover, do that on the rower. In workouts like these, take it one round at a time and don’t get ahead of yourself or bother looking at the clock — it will only disappoint you.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the dumbbell. Reduce the reps of the burpees and the hang clean-to-overheads. Reduce the distance on the rower. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the lateral burpees over the dumbbell, perform these as standard burpees. For the hang clean-to-overheads, consider muscle clean and shoulder presses or kettlebell swings. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the row, consider a 200-meter run or a 400-meter bike. For the lateral burpees over the dumbbell, perform up-downs over the dumbbell or in place. For the dumbbell hang clean-to-overheads, perform hang clean and shoulder presses with a medicine ball or a single-arm Russian kettlebell swing if there is an overhead limitation. 
 
**Intermediate option:**  
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 20 minutes of:  
20 lateral burpees over the dumbbell  
20 alternating dumbbell hang clean-to-overheads

**10 burpees**  
**10** alternating dumbbell hang clean-to-overheads  
200-meter row


♀ **10**-lb dumbbell  
♂ **15**-lb dumbbell


**Coaching cues:**  
During the row, ensure you maintain the proper sequencing of each pull for the most efficiency and power output, and to preserve your energy and push harder for longer. Think about moving through each pull by initiating with a leg drive, then shifting your hips back, and finally pulling with your arms. On the return, it’s the opposite — the arms straighten, the hips flex, and then the legs bend.

400-meter run  
30 GHD sit-ups  
100-foot front-rack walking lunge


♀ 65 lb  
♂ 95 lb 


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a bit of a midline mash-up. Expect the GHD sit-ups and the front-rack lunges to conflict with one another and make running more challenging. Aim to complete this workout in about 20 minutes or less. Choose a weight for the lunges that allows you to complete the distance in 2 sets or less in each round. If you are not familiar with the GHD sit-up or are not consistently performing the movement, reduce the reps and range of motion.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the reps of the GHD sit-ups. Reduce the distance of the run and the front-rack lunge. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the GHD sit-ups, limit the range of motion. For the front-rack lunges, consider using a pair of dumbbells to help minimize issues with the rack position. 

In case of injury or limitation, for the run, complete 900/1,250 meters on the Echo bike, or 400/500 meters on the rower or ski erg. For the GHD sit-ups, perform V-ups or sit-ups. For the front-rack lunge, perform this movement with no weight or consider a low box step-up. 
 
**Intermediate option:**  
3 rounds for time of:  
400-meter run  
**20** GHD sit-ups **to parallel**

**Beginner option:**   
3 rounds for time of:  
**200**-meter run  
**20 AbMat sit-ups**

**Coaching cues:**  
For the front-rack walking lunge, step long, keep your chest up, and drive through your front heel. Avoid letting your knee cave inward.

[What 16 Years of Coaching CrossFit Has Taught Me](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-16-years-coaching)

After 16 years in CrossFit — from a 90-pound-overweight beginner who could barely complete 3 rounds of Cindy to an affiliate owner and coach across two countries — I've learned that the most powerful question in fitness isn't about programming or technique. It's simply: ""What would happen if I just showed up every day?"" This is the story of how that question transformed not just my body, but my life's purpose, and why the path from athlete to coach might be the most rewarding journey you never saw coming.

"Wednesday 250827","For time:  
50 deadlifts  
40 pull-ups  
30-calorie row  
20 chest-to-bar pull-ups  
10 squat cleans


♀ 125 lb  
♂ 185 lb 


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a chipper. Aim to complete this effort in 15 minutes or less. The loading of the barbell should be light-to-moderate for the deadlifts and moderate-to-heavy for the squat cleans. This means you should be able to consistently perform larger chunks of reps on the deadlifts and singles for the squat cleans. Manage your pace on the rower in anticipation of the final two movements. Don’t push too hard on the rower and end up putting yourself in a “hole” for the remainder of the workout.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the reps of each of the movements. 
 
To reduce the complexity of deadlifts, perform sumo deadlifts. This will reduce the difficulty in navigating the knees. For the pull-ups, reduce the range of motion. For the squat cleans, consider hang squat cleans or a power cleans. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the deadlifts, consider kettlebell sumo deadlifts or unloaded good mornings. For the pull-ups, consider ring rows. For the squat cleans, consider dumbbell squat cleans or dumbbell power cleans if there is a squat limitation. For the row, use whatever machine is available to perform the calories. 
 
**Intermediate option:**

50 deadlifts  
40 **jumping** pull-ups

**35 ring rows**  
**25**-calorie row  
**15 jumping pull-ups**  
**5** squat cleans


♀ **35** lb  
♂ **45** lb


**Coaching cues:**  
In the squat clean, drive your hips forward, squeeze your glutes at the top, and make sure you finish the pull before pulling under the bar.

21-15-9 reps for time of:  
Handstand push-ups  
Ring dips  
Push-ups


Post time to comments.

Compare to [210623](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2021/06/23).

In honor of Petty Officer 1st Class Jeff Taylor, 30, of Midway, West Virginia, who was killed on June 28, 2005, while conducting combat operations in the vicinity of Asadabad, Afghanistan, in Kumar Province. He is survived by his father, John; mother, Carrie; and wife, Erin.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout can be polarizing, depending on your strengths and weaknesses. Regardless, the push-up will arguably be the most difficult reps you have ever attempted. That said, for most, this is a workout that requires patience and perseverance. Expect to experience muscular fatigue rather than cardio-respiratory fatigue. When dealing with muscular fatigue, you must rest long enough for your muscles to recover before you continue. Manage your reps to allow for minimal rest during breaks and minimize the potential for muscular failure. If you have completed this workout in the past, look back at your previous effort to help navigate today’s effort.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps of each movement.  

To reduce the complexity of the handstand push-up, perform pike push-ups. For the ring dips, perform jumping or banded ring dips. For the push-ups, perform from the knees.
  
In case of injury or limitation, for the handstand push-ups, perform seated dumbbell shoulder presses. For the ring dips, perform foot-assisted ring dips or straight bar dips. For the push-ups, perform these with your hands on an elevated surface like a 30-inch box.  

**Intermediate option:**  
21-15-9 reps for time of:

♂ 70-lb kettlebell


Post reps to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout contains 6 sprint-style intervals. In order to get the most out of this effort, choose a jump rope variation that gives you around 30 seconds to perform kettlebell swings. The kettlebell loading should be something heavier than you may normally swing, but manageable enough that you can swing it for the entirety of the remaining time in the interval.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the kettlebell. Reduce the reps of the double-unders. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the jump rope, consider performing single-unders. For the kettlebell swings, reduce the range of motion. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the double-unders, perform penguin taps or consider 7/9 calories on a bike. For the kettlebell swings, perform single-arm swings or kettlebell sumo deadlifts.

[From Couch to 4,000 Workouts: How CrossFit Saved My Parents' Lives at 55](https://youtu.be/oZEmZhBEfdQ)


Seventeen years ago, Jocelyn Rylee, Level 4 CrossFit coach, Seminar Staff trainer, and owner of CrossFit Brio, convinced her two morbidly obese 55-year-old parents to do CrossFit. They couldn't do a lunge without assistance or run 800 meters. Today, they are 73, have both survived cancer, and have completed over 2,000 CrossFit workouts each. Jocelyn’s mom has lived 15 years longer than her own mother did, and her dad's cardiologists called his cardiovascular system ""the cleanest they'd ever seen"" after emergency open-heart surgery. This is proof that it's never too late to completely transform your life — but you have to be willing to start.

Dumbbell thrusters


♀ 20-lb dumbbells  
♂ 35-lb dumbbells


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
This descending rep scheme contains two movements with longer ranges of motion. Choose a weight for the dumbbell thrusters that allows you to finish your reps in 2 sets or less. Challenge yourself to go unbroken on as many sets as possible. For the knees-to-elbows, choose a movement variation that allows you to maintain consistent sets of 5 or more reps.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the dumbbells. Reduce the reps of each movement. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the knees-to-elbows, bring the knees to a lower target. For the dumbbell thrusters, perform the movement with a single dumbbell or perform medicine-ball thrusters. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the knees-to-elbows, perform V-ups or sit-ups. For the thrusters, perform front squats if there is an overhead limitation or push presses if there is a squatting limitation.

"Friday 250822","3 rounds for time of:  
800-meter run  
30 GHD hip and back extensions


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
In today’s workout, we lengthen out the time domain and focus on kinesthetic awareness. The glute-ham developer (GHD) is a powerful piece of equipment that can help you develop midline stabilization and an understanding of where your body is in space. Choose a variation of the GHD movement that allows you to stay in control and work through quality reps. Push the pace on the runs as you are able.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps of the GHD hip and back extensions. Reduce the distance of the run.  

To reduce the complexity of the GHD hip and back extensions, perform back extensions or hip extensions.  

In case of injury or limitation, for the GHD hip and back extensions, perform good mornings or unloaded Jefferson curls. For the run, perform 1,750/2,500 meters on the Echo bike or 800/1,000 meters on the rower.


**Intermediate option:**  
3 rounds for time of:  
800-meter run  
**20 GHD back extensions**


**Beginner option:**   
3 rounds for time of:  
**400**-meter run  
**15 GHD hip extensions**


**Coaching cues:**  
Take your time on the hip and back extensions. Focus on moving each body part independently of the other. Initiate the movement with trunk flexion, followed by flexing at the hip, and then reclaiming trunk extension in the bottom position. In the lifting phase, the trunk moves back into flexion as the hips extend, and the movement finishes with the trunk extended and parallel to the floor. Watch the movement demonstration carefully to get the best understanding of this movement.

[Dissecting the Squat](https://library.crossfit.com/free/pdf/CFJ_2015_10_Squat_Long2.pdf) 
 
We take squatting very seriously in CrossFit. In the world of athletic development, the squat is the most important exercise for developing powerful hip extension, and therefore one of the best for improving athleticism. More than that, however, is that you need to be able to squat to stand from a seated position. So, we need to squat, and if we can’t, we have to figure out whether it’s a mobility issue or motor-control imbalance. In this 2015 article, Dr. Zachary Long shares three tests that will help you determine which one it is and how to fix it.

Back squat, 1 rep  
Shoulder press, 1 rep  
Deadlift, 1 rep


Post loads to comments.

Compare to [240515](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2024/05/15).


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today is an opportunity to go heavy relative to your capacity. Be sure to look back at your previous attempts to help you navigate today’s effort. The loads today should require all of your attention and focus. The load is not heavy if you can carry on a conversation mid-lift. Advanced and intermediate athletes may attempt max-effort lifts for each movement and shoot for a personal record if the iron is hot. Newer athletes should treat today as an opportunity to practice technique and get comfortable with heavy lifts.


**Scaling:**  
To reduce the complexity of the back squat, perform your reps to a target that provides pain-free range of motion. For the shoulder press, use a pair of dumbbells to avoid having to navigate the head. For the deadlift, shorten the range of motion by raising the bumper plates off the floor. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the back squat, perform a dumbbell goblet squat or an air squat. For the shoulder press, shorten the range of motion by performing an incline press or bench press. If necessary, you can perform a push-up. For the deadlift, perform a sumo deadlift or a good morning.


**Intermediate option:**  
Same as Rx’d.


**Beginner option:**   
Back squat **3-3-1-1** reps  
Shoulder press **3-3-1-1** reps  
Deadlift **3-3-1-1** reps


**Coaching cues:**  
In the shoulder press, tighten your core, squeeze your glutes, and press straight up — don’t let the bar drift forward.

Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout combines challenging gymnastics elements with a moderate weightlifting movement. As your midline muscles fatigue from the L-sit holds, expect the rope climbs and the snatches to become more difficult. Choose a weight for the barbell that allows you to maintain a cadence of 6 or more reps per minute. Your best strategy on the snatches will be quick singles. Snatches may be performed as a power or squat variation. On the L-sit holds, choose an option that allows you to consistently hold for 10 seconds or more. Manage the pace of the rope climbs. 


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the duration of the L-sit holds. Reduce the number of reps for the rope climbs. Reduce the loading of the snatches. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the L-sit holds, bend one leg or tuck both knees in toward the chest. For the legless rope climbs, reduce height or perform legged rope climbs. For the rope climbs, reduce the height or perform 3 strict pull-ups per rope climb. For the snatches, consider performing hang snatches. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the L-sit holds, perform plank holds. For the rope climbs, perform pull-to-stands or ring rows. For the snatches, perform kettlebell swings or dumbbell snatches. If necessary, perform cleans if there is an overhead limitation.

♂ 50-lb dumbbells


Post rounds and reps to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a longer-duration grind. Use a loading for the dumbbells that allows you to complete the farmers carry and front squats unbroken throughout the workout. Your goal should be to perform a round at least every 4 minutes. If you can move faster, do it. For intermediate athletes who are capable of performing bar muscle-ups, but not the volume of the prescribed workout, reduce the reps, and use this workout as an opportunity to practice and develop the skill. 


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the dumbbells. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the bar muscle-ups, consider jumping bar muscle-ups, chest-to-bar pull-ups, or chin-over-bar pull-ups. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the dumbbell farmers carry, consider single-dumbbell carries or low box step-ups. For the dumbbell front squats, consider single-dumbbell goblet squats or unloaded air squats. For the burpees, consider up-downs. For the bar muscle-ups, consider low-ring muscle-up transitions or ring rows.

"Friday 250815","Clean and jerk 2-2-2-2-2 reps


Post loads to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a classic lifting day. Depending on how you feel, use today as an opportunity to work on technique or to lift something relatively heavy. The repetitions in each set do not have to be touch-and-go. You may regrip and take no more than 10 seconds to complete the second lift. The clean in today’s effort can be performed as a power or squat variation. Newer athletes should focus on developing consistently sound mechanics before adding weight.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the movements, consider performing hang power or hang squat cleans. For the jerk portion of the movement, consider push presses. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, perform dumbbell clean and jerks. If there is an overhead limitation, perform only the clean portion of the movement. 
 
**Intermediate option:**  
Same as Rx’d.


**Beginner option:**   
Clean and jerk **4-4-4-4-4** reps


**Coaching cues:**  
In the jerk, focus on keeping the elbows high as you perform the dip and drive. Higher elbows will help keep the torso vertical and ensure the barbell travels in a more straight path overhead.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is an ascending ladder of three relatively simple movements. While the first few sets will seem easy, the workout will become increasingly more challenging as you continue to add reps. The loading of the kettlebell should allow you to maintain unbroken reps for most of the workout.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the kettlebell. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the air squat, perform to a target. For the AbMat sit-ups, consider anchoring the feet. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the air squats, consider lunges or low box step-ups. For the AbMat sit-ups, consider plank holds. For the Russian kettlebell swings, consider kettlebell deadlifts or unloaded good mornings.

Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is an upper-body stamina-based chipper with a few consistent sets of double-unders. Relax your upper body when you are working with the jump rope, and manage your reps on the handstand push-ups and wall walks. On the handstand push-ups, consider consistent sets of 5-10 reps with minimal rest in between. For the wall walks, consider counting to 5-10 seconds in between each walk. If you are able, push the pace on the jump rope and the box jumps.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps of each movement. Reduce the height of the box. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the double-unders, consider performing 1 minute of double-under practice or single-unders. For the handstand push-ups, consider performing a pike push-up. For the box jumps, perform step-ups. For the wall walks, reduce the range of motion by taking a limited number of steps back to the wall. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, for the double-unders, perform penguin taps or 10/15 calories on any machine. For the handstand push-ups, consider seated dumbbell shoulder presses or push-ups. For the wall walks, consider performing inchworms with your feet on the floor or elevated on a box.

"Monday 250811","**Strict Nicole**

Complete as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes of:  
Run 400 meters  
Max-rep strict pull-ups


Post the number of pull-ups completed for each round to comments.


Compare to [241224](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2024/12/24).


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
This variation of the classic workout Nicole calls for strict pull-ups. Use the run as recovery for the next set of pull-ups. Athletes should aim to complete around 5-6 sets within the 20-minute timeframe. Choose an option for the strict pull-ups that allows you to work on a weakness.


**Scaling:**  
To limit the total amount of volume, you can cap your pull-ups in each round. For example, perform only 3-5 strict pull-ups per round instead of pushing to failure. 
 
If you have strict pull-ups but are unable to perform at least 5 reps, begin each set with a max set of strict pull-ups, then stay on the bar for a max set of kipping pull-ups. If you do not yet have strict pull-ups, perform a moderately challenging version of banded strict pull-ups or ring rows. 
 
In case of injury or limitation, perform 800/1,000 meters on a bike or 400/500 meters on a rower. For the strict pull-ups, you can perform a single-arm dumbbell bent-over row. 
 
**Intermediate option:**  
Complete as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes of:  
Run 400 meters  
Max-rep strict pull-ups **+ kipping pull-ups**

[Gymnailing It: Pistols and Overhead Squats](https://journal.crossfit.com/article/crossover1-gagnon)


While many CrossFit athletes often view the pistol as just another skill to check off their list, gymnasts understand its true value as a foundation for more complex movements requiring balance, coordination, and flexibility. This article reveals how mastering pistol variations can directly improve your overhead squats, snatches, and snatch balances by developing the ankle mobility, unilateral strength, and spatial awareness these lifts demand. Learn two key drills: the two-legged pistol and candlestick pistol. These will build the neurological skills needed to excel in loaded overhead movements.

♀ 20-lb medicine ball to a 9-foot target  
♂ 30-lb medicine ball to a 10-foot target


Post total wall-ball-shot reps to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout will test your mental fortitude. How many wall-ball shots can you perform before you mentally and physically need a break? Just when you think you are ready to stop, remember, you can always do one more rep. To get the most out of the effort, choose a load that allows you to perform at least 25 repetitions in each set. As an added challenge, push the pace on the rower. This will make for an extra special time.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the medicine ball. Reduce the distance on the rower. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the wall-ball shots, perform dumbbell thrusters with a light pair of dumbbells. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, for the wall-ball shots, perform medicine-ball front squats (overhead limitation) or medicine-ball push presses (squat limitation). For the row, perform 1,250 meters on the Echo bike, 400-meter run, or 500 meters on the ski erg.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a test of barbell stamina. In the first few sets, expect a lot of rest; however, the rest will begin to disappear very soon. You may want to consider a combination of quick singles and touch-and-go reps. Consider using a weight that is challenging, but allows you to get to 10 minutes.

**Scaling:**

[Gymnailing It: Stick the Landing, Make the Lift](https://journal.crossfit.com/article/crossover2-gagnon)


Many CrossFit athletes wish they had gymnastics training as kids because it builds the foundational body control that makes learning Olympic lifts significantly easier. Coach Mike Burgener notes that ""90 percent of missed lifts are attributed to the feet."" This article breaks down how gymnastics skills like ""sticking the landing"" directly translate to weightlifting success and provides simple jump-stick drills that will improve your spatial awareness, balance, and lifting technique. Master these foundational movement patterns, and you'll find yourself making more lifts with better control and confidence.

Post loads to comments.


Compare to [241028](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2024/10/28).


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today is a heavy lifting day. Remember that “heavy” is relative to each athlete's physical and psychological tolerances. In other words, heavy is going to be different for each athlete. Most athletes can complete this lifting day as prescribed. Newer athletes should start light, focus on mechanics, and slowly add weight as they are comfortable.


Considering the heavy loading of the barbell, you are encouraged to find a spotter. However, if you are not able to find a spotter, use some type of guard rails or simply reduce the load to something you can manage without a spotter.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the bench press, consider performing dumbbell bench presses. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing dumbbell floor presses, weighted push-ups, or push-ups.


**Intermediate option:**  
Same as Rx’d.


**Beginner option:**   
Same as Rx’d.


**Coaching cues:**  
Be sure your feet are firmly planted on the ground. This will enable you to drive through your heels and get the lower body involved in your lifts.

♂ 50-lb dumbbell


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout contains two rounds with higher repetitions of each movement. With higher reps, manage your pace and move to rest minimally during your breaks. Athletes who want a challenge should go unbroken on the snatches and go right into the lunges. If you choose this route, buckle up and enjoy the ride. For the dumbbell lunges, carry the dumbbell however you like.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the dumbbell. Reduce the repetitions of each exercise. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the dumbbell snatches, perform hang dumbbell snatches. For the dumbbell lunges, perform without a dumbbell. For the lateral burpees over the dumbbell, perform burpees in place. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, for the dumbbell snatches, perform kettlebell swings or dumbbell cleans if there is an overhead limitation. For the dumbbell lunges, consider dumbbell step-ups to a low box or air squats to a target. For the lateral burpees over the dumbbell, perform up-downs.

A Tabata interval is 20 seconds of work followed by 10 seconds of rest for 8 intervals. Your score is the total reps accumulated. 


Post reps to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is all about work and rest intervals, so choose options that allow you to move for as much of the work intervals as possible. Perform all 8 intervals of one movement before moving onto the next movement. Use caution on the GHD — if you are not consistently using the GHD to perform sit-ups or hip extensions, consider the scaling options below.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the total number of sets for each exercise. Consider 4 or 6 sets instead of 8. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the GHD sit-ups, decrease the range of motion. For the GHD hip extensions, decrease the range of motion or consider performing Superman holds on the GHD. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, for the GHD sit-ups, perform V-ups or AbMat sit-ups. For the GHD hip extensions, perform unloaded good mornings. Look to replace the Echo bike with any machine you have available.

Squat cleans  
Ring muscle-ups  


♀ 95 lb  
♂ 135 lb


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a play on the benchmark workout Amanda — two higher-skill movements with slightly more reps than the original workout. The loading on the squat cleans should be moderate. Some athletes may be able to maintain touch-and-go reps, while others may choose to perform quick singles. On the ring muscle-ups, manage your reps and don’t push to failure. Instead, break the sets into manageable reps that allow you to stay fresh and minimize long-winded breaks.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the repetitions of the muscle-ups. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the squat cleans, consider hang squat cleans or perform the movement with a pair of dumbbells. For the muscle-ups, consider jumping muscle-ups or low-ring muscle-up transitions. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, perform power or hang power cleans. Consider single dumbbell options, as well. For the ring muscle-ups, perform ring rows or foot-assisted strict pull-ups.


**Intermediate option:**    
For time:   
12-9-6 squat cleans

"Friday 250801","**2025 CrossFit Games Event 1**


For time:  
4-mile run  
3,000-meter row  
2-mile run


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**
Today’s workout is the first event in the 2025 CrossFit Games. This effort focuses on cardiorespiratory endurance and stamina. This workout is also reminiscent of a Hero workout we completed on 250721: Jerry. However, the distances in this effort are longer. Plan for the workout to take some time. Have fun with this one today!


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of each run and row. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, for the run, consider a 22,000-meter Echo bike. For the row, consider a 3,000-meter run, a 3,000-meter ski erg, or a 7,000-meter Echo bike.


**Intermediate option:**  
For time:  
**3**-mile run  
**2,000**-meter row  
**1**-mile run  


**Beginner option:**   
For time:  
**1**-mile run  
**1,000**-meter row  
**1**-mile run  


**Coaching cues:**  
On the rower, focus on your stroke rate. To do so, consider the time it takes you to return the handle to the catch position. Increase or decrease your rate based on your ability to recover and prepare for the final run.

CrossFit's core mission is to develop broad fitness capacity. This mission is often misunderstood, particularly regarding the relationship between health and elite performance. Senior Content Writer for CrossFit, Stephane Rochet, argues elite fitness isn't exclusive to Games competitors but represents the natural outcome of consistent, intense training focused on health across all time and movement domains. This conversation challenges the false dichotomy between health and high performance, suggesting that pursuing anything less than elite fitness essentially means settling for mediocrity.

Thrusters  
Pull-ups


♀ 65 lb  
♂ 95 lb


Compare to [240325](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2024/03/25).


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
If you have never completed Fran before, it is intended to be a sprint. Experienced athletes should go hard and shoot for a PR. Choose a load for the thrusters that allows you to complete at least 15 unbroken reps. Select a pull-up option that allows you to complete each round with minimal rest. All athletes should aim to finish the workout in 10 minutes or less. However, if you would like to attempt the prescribed workout, knowing it's going to take you longer, go for it. As long as you maintain form and technique, this is a great opportunity to establish a time. Intermediate and beginner athletes should establish a goal for this workout and create a plan for breaking up the thrusters and/or pull-ups as necessary.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the reps of the pull-ups. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the pull-ups, consider jumping pull-ups or ring rows. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, consider front squats (overhead limitation) or push presses (squatting limitation) in place of the thrusters. For the pull-ups, consider one-arm ring rows or dumbbell rows.


**Intermediate option:**    
For time:  
21-15-9 thrusters  
**12-9-6** pull-ups


♀ **55** lb  
♂ **75** lb


**Beginner option:**

♀ **35** lb  
♂ **45** lb


**Coaching cues:**  
Unlike the gymnastics-style kipping pull-ups, on the descent of the butterfly pull-up, move your legs behind you and prepare them to move forward to initiate the next rep. (See demo video.)

Post loads to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today is a heavy day. As always, heavy is relative to each athlete's capacity and experience. You will benefit from today's effort if you work to your limits. Look back at your previous heavy deadlift efforts to help navigate today’s loading. Experienced athletes should build in load and plan to go as heavy as possible across all sets. Newer athletes should start light, focus on mechanics, and slowly add weight as they are comfortable.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell as needed to maintain consistently sound mechanics. If you are unable to achieve a sound setup with the barbell on the floor, consider lifting from an elevated surface.  

To adjust the complexity of the lift, consider performing a sumo deadlift, or deadlift with a pair of kettlebells or dumbbells. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing good mornings or GHD hip extensions.


**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.


**Beginner option:**   
Same as Rx’d.


**Coaching cues:**  
As you set up to pull the barbell off the floor, pull the “slack” out of your arms by trying to “break” the barbell across your shins.

20 double-unders

♂ 155-lb barbell


Compare to [250319](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2025/03/19).


Post rounds and reps to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a triplet with a low volume of reps in each set. Look back at your previous score to help navigate today’s effort. Expect to perform at least 6 rounds, knowing round times may decrease due to upper-body fatigue and the interfering lockout positions of the hang power snatches and strict handstand push-ups. By design, this workout demands upper-body stamina, strength, and endurance. To avoid hitting a wall, be intentional with your rest time between movements, and focus on using your legs in the hang power snatches to get the barbell overhead.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell.  

To reduce the complexity of the jump rope, work for no more than 30 seconds, accumulating double-under reps. If necessary, perform single-unders or penguin hops. For the strict handstand push-ups, reduce the reps to no less than 3 in each round. You can also perform dumbbell push presses or shoulder presses as an alternative. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, consider riding a bike for 30 seconds per round in place of the jump rope. If you have an overhead limitation, perform single-arm dumbbell snatches or hang power cleans in place of the hang power snatches. For the strict handstand push-ups, consider push-ups or plank holds.


**Intermediate option:**  
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 15 minutes of:

[A Better Way to Track Progress Than Body Fat Testing](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-tracking-body-fat)


Despite months of consistent training and clean eating, your expensive DEXA scan shows your body fat percentage has actually increased, leaving you confused and discouraged. The truth is, we're obsessing over numbers that fluctuate based on hydration, timing, and other variables, while ignoring metrics that actually matter for health and fitness. Here's what really matters when it comes to body fat.

"Saturday 250726","3 rounds for time of:  
22/30-calorie row  
5 rope climbs to 15 feet


Post times to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout will challenge your efficiency and technique with the combination of the two movements. In both the row and rope climb, you can use your upper body to accomplish the task. However, that would be extremely inefficient and lead to localized muscle fatigue pretty quickly. So, focus on the concept of core-to-extremity when performing these movements. On the rope climbs, use your legs before you reach with the arms. And on the rower, drive with the legs before finishing with the pull.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the calories on the rower. Reduce the reps of the rope climb. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the rope climbs, reduce the height of the climbs. You could also practice jumping up on the rope and establishing a secure foothold, then coming down. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, perform your calories on any machine available. For the rope climb, consider pull-to-stands on the rope. If you do not have a rope, consider towel pull-ups or strict pull-ups.


**Intermediate option:**    
3 rounds for time of:  
**18/24**-calorie row  
**3** rope climbs to **12** feet


**Beginner option:**   
3 rounds for time of:  
**10/15**-calorie row  
**3 pull-to-stands**


**Coaching cues:**  
Think of the rope climb as a squatting movement. Reach up on the rope as high as you can, then, with straight arms, lean back and bring your knees to your elbows. Then, simply stand up out of the bottom of the squat.

Post total back squat reps to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
In today’s workout, expect the plank holds and box jumps to have a significant effect on the back squats at the end of the workout. The plank hold will challenge your midline, while the box jumps will get the legs nice and tired. Perform the plank holds on the forearms or the hands (your choice). Choose options for the plank holds and box jumps that allow you to get to the back squats with at least 2 minutes to perform squats. Then, once you have the barbell on your back, challenge yourself not to put the bar down until time expires.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the height of the box jump-overs. Reduce the duration of the plank holds. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the plank holds, perform from the knees. For the box jump-overs, perform box step-up overs. For the back squats, consider dumbbell or kettlebell goblet squats. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, perform plank holds with your hands on a 24- or 30-inch box. For the back squats, perform air squats or lunges.

[Scientific Integrity Under Fire: A Point-by-Point Refutation of Misleading CrossFit Research](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-misleading-research)  

A recent peer-reviewed article about CrossFit appeared to offer scientific insights into training strategies; however, a closer examination reveals numerous fabricated statistics, misrepresented studies, and unsupported claims regarding injury rates. This systematic analysis exposes over a dozen factual errors that paint an unfairly negative picture of CrossFit's safety profile, echoing past controversies where false data was used to attack CrossFit’s reputation.

Post total time (including rest) to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
In today’s workout, you have three intervals to push through — move as quickly as possible through each interval. The rest between each set won’t be enough for full recovery, but just enough to allow you to push through the next interval. Use a weight for the power cleans that allows you to complete your reps in about 1 minute or less. Have fun with this one, and try to keep your foot on the gas.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the reps of the shuttle runs and the burpees. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the power cleans, perform hang power cleans or use a pair of dumbbells. For the bar-facing burpees, consider bar-facing up-downs, or regular burpees or up-downs. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, perform single-arm dumbbell power cleans or kettlebell swings. For the shuttle runs, consider a 900/1,250-meter Echo bike.

Gymnastics-style kipping pull-ups


♀ 35 lb  
♂ 50 lb


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
In today’s workout, choose a weight that allows you to perform at least 10 reps unbroken every time you pick up the dumbbell. For this workout, we are removing the option of performing a butterfly pull-up. You will notice the toes-to-bars and the gymnastics-style kipping pull-ups have the same movement pattern. Expect these two movements to provide a unique stimulus. If you only perform butterfly pull-ups, it's time to relearn. We see the kip swing in so many movements, from toes-to-bars to bar and ring muscle-ups, and, of course, the kipping pull-up. This is all the more reason to work on this movement pattern and always keep it in your toolbag. 


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the dumbbell. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the dumbbell shoulder-to-overheads, consider shoulder presses. For the toes-to-bars, reduce the range of motion. Consider knees-to-chests or hanging knee raises as potential options. For the kipping pull-ups, perform jumping pull-ups.  

In case of an injury or limitation, perform V-ups or sit-ups in place of the toes-to-bars. For the kipping pull-ups, perform ring rows.

Sgt. Maj. Jerry Dwayne Patton, 40, died on Oct. 15, 2008, during High Altitude High Opening (HAHO) training while assigned to Army USSOCOM preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Jerry is survived by his wife, Molly; and his sons Chad, Cody, Chase, and Connor.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today, we’re doing a CrossFit Hero workout. This effort challenges your cardio-respiratory endurance and stamina. The first run is a “trap” — don’t go out too hot. Push yourself on the rower, but only as much as you can finish, then immediately start running your second mile. Finishing 10 seconds faster on the rower isn’t worth it if it causes you to walk the first hundred meters of your run. The second run is all about emptying the tank.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distances of both runs and the row.  

In case of an injury or limitation, for the run, perform 3,500/5,000 meters on an Echo bike.


**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.


**Beginner option:**   
For time:  
Run **800** meters  
Row **1,000** meters  
Run **800** meters  


**Coaching cues:**  
To keep the rowing stroke smooth and the chain straight, imagine you are rowing with the handle on a table. As you pull, the handle is going to go back with the palms on top of the table, and in the return, the knuckles will be underneath the table.

Chief Petty Officer Nate Hardy was killed Sunday Feb. 4, 2012, during combat operations in Iraq. Nate is survived by his wife, Mindi, and his son, Parker.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s effort is the Hero workout Nate. If you have completed this workout in the past, look back to your score to help you navigate today’s effort. The kettlebell loading should be moderate and allow you to go unbroken through all rounds. Athletes completing this workout as prescribed should aim to complete a round in 2 minutes or less. Today is a great opportunity for intermediate athletes to practice muscle-ups and handstand push-ups, even if it means completing fewer rounds.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the kettlebell. Reduce the reps of the muscle-ups and handstand push-ups. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the ring muscle-ups, perform jumping muscle-ups or low-ring muscle-up transitions. For the handstand push-ups, perform pike push-ups or dumbbell shoulder presses. For the kettlebell swings, reduce the range of motion. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, perform ring rows or foot-assisted strict pull-ups for the muscle-ups. For the handstand push-ups, perform single-arm dumbbell shoulder presses or push-ups. For the kettlebell swings, consider single-arm Russian kettlebell swings or unloaded good mornings.


**Intermediate option:**   
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 20 minutes of:   
2 **jumping** ring muscle-ups  
4 **pike** push-ups  
8 kettlebell swings


♀ **35** lb  
♂ **53** lb


**Beginner option:**  
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 20 minutes of:  
2 **low-ring** muscle-up **transitions**  
4 **dumbbell shoulder presses**  
8 kettlebell swings


♀ **18**-lb kettlebell and **15-lb dumbbells**  
♂ **26**-lb kettlebell and **20-lb dumbbells**


**Coaching cues:**  
Try starting your first kettlebell swing of every set with the kettlebell set up slightly in front of the toes. Then, like a center hiking a football, “hike” the kettlebell back between your legs and then drive it over head.

50 front squats


Every time you drop the bar, complete 20/30 calories on the Echo bike.


♀ 125 lb  
♂ 185 lb


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a challenge. How long can you hang on to the barbell before you have to break and accept the “penalty”? Choose a weight that allows you to complete consistent sets of 10 or more repetitions. Challenge yourself with the loading, but don’t make the workout impossible. Keep in mind that the bike is only going to make each set more difficult. Don’t dig yourself a hole by pushing the pace too hard on the bike. Bigger sets on the barbell is more important.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the calories on the bike.  

To reduce the complexity of the front squats, consider using a pair of dumbbells if there are any front-rack limitations. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation,  perform back squats, goblet squats, or air squats in place of the front squats. For the calories on the bike, use any machine available.


**Intermediate option:**  
For time:  
50 front squats

**Coaching cues:**  
To help keep the barbell on the body for more reps, focus on keeping the elbows up. The further the barbell gets away from the body, the more difficult the movement will be.

15 dumbbell deadlifts  
50-foot handstand walk


♀ 35-lb dumbbells  
♂ 50-lb dumbbells


Post round and reps to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a back-and-forth couplet. The loading of the dumbbell should allow you to perform your reps unbroken in each set. Choose an option for the handstand walk that allows you to complete each set in 45 seconds or less. Sticking to this stimulus should allow you to complete at least 5 rounds, although you will definitely see some scores close to a round per minute. Prior to starting the workout, spend some time practicing handstand walks and getting upside down. For the deadlifts, you can put the dumbbells inside your legs like a sumo deadlift or keep them on the outside like a conventional deadlift.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the dumbbells. Reduce the distance of the handstand walk. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the handstand walk, consider performing 20 shoulder taps against the wall or with your feet on a box. You may also consider 3-5 inchworms or a bear crawl. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation,  perform single-kettlebell sumo deadlifts or unloaded good mornings in place of the deadlifts. For the handstand walks, consider seated alternating light dumbbell shoulder presses.


**Intermediate option:**    
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 10 minutes of:

15 shoulder-to-overheads  


♀ 105-lb barbell  
♂ 155-lb barbell


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
In today’s workout, be sure to pay attention to the reps of each movement as they flip-flop after the second run. Push for bigger sets where you can. The first set of chest-to-bars is relatively low volume, so if you can go unbroken, do it. The second set may require a few more sets with quick breaks. The same can be said for the shoulder-to-overheads. Push the runs if you are able, but not at the expense of “long-winded” breaks on the other two movements.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the distance of the runs. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the chest-to-bar pull-ups, decrease the range of motion. Consider chin-over-bar pull-ups or jumping chest-to-bar pull-ups. For the shoulder-to-overheads, consider performing shoulder presses or using a pair of dumbbells if you are having difficulty with the rack position. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, perform a 1,750/2,500-meter Echo bike or 800/1,000-meter row in place of the 800-meter run. For the chest-to-bar pull-ups, perform ring rows or dumbbell bent-over rows. For the shoulder-to-overheads, perform single-arm dumbbell shoulder-to-overheads or push-ups.

Double-unders


Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a spin-off of the classic benchmark Annie. Be prepared for fatigued hip flexors. This may make jumping and consistent sets of double-unders more challenging. That said, consider butterflying your legs on the sit-ups to negate the hip flexors as much as possible with that movement. Aim to complete this workout in 15 minutes or less.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps of each movement. Consider 25-20-25-10-5 as a possible alternative rep scheme. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the double-unders, consider performing 30 seconds of attempts for each set of double-unders. You might also consider performing single-unders. 
 
In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing plank holds in place of the sit-ups. Perform each hold for the same number of seconds as there are reps in each set. For the double-unders, consider performing 10-8-6-4-2 calories on any machine available. For the walking-lunge steps, consider low box step-ups or air squats to a target.

[Is Zone 2 Magic?](https://youtu.be/KKEeWEKnWkY)

Is Zone 2 a magical fitness secret? Is it really better than what you're already doing in CrossFit? Veteran athletes and coaches Eric O’Connor and Stephane Rochet break down the truth about energy systems, why you don't need fancy heart rate monitors or complicated training zones, and how CrossFit's ""short, medium, long"" approach actually gives you better results across the board. They'll show you why chasing that ""conversational pace"" isn't the holy grail of longevity or health, and reveal how your regular Fran, Cindy, and heavy lifting days are already hitting every energy system more effectively than any Zone 2 protocol ever could. Spoiler alert: the real magic isn't in the zone — it's in the variety.

Farmers carry

♂ 70-lb kettlebells

Post total distance to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is both a mental and physical grind. There is not much to this effort — grab a pair of kettlebells and get to work. Consider a work-to-rest strategy. Whether it is moving for a certain distance before putting the weight down or moving for a certain amount of time, both are good plans of attack and will keep you engaged for 20 minutes.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the kettlebells. Reduce the duration of the workout.  

To reduce the complexity of the farmers carry, consider using one kettlebell and switching hands as needed. You may also consider carrying the kettlebell (or a dumbbell) on the shoulder instead of in the farmers carry position.   

In case of an injury or limitation, consider wearing a weighted vest instead of carrying a kettlebell or dumbbell. Other options could include pushing or pulling a sled, or a combination of both.


**Intermediate option:**

30 wall-ball shots


Rest with any remaining time in the interval.


♀ 14-lb medicine ball to a 9-foot target  
♂ 20-lb medicine ball to a 10-foot target


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is three intervals. The faster you complete the interval, the more rest you get before the next. The goal is to have at least 1 minute of rest; however, more than 2 minutes is definitely possible. Push the pace on each movement and don’t hold anything back. There is nothing to gain from “gaming” each interval. Push hard and see what happens.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance on the rower. Reduce the loading of the wall-ball shots.  

To reduce the complexity of the lateral burpees over the rower, perform burpees with a step over the rower or burpees in place. For the wall-ball shots, reduce the height of the target.  

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing up-downs in place of the burpees. If you have an overhead limitation, perform medicine-ball front squats or if there is a squatting limitation, perform medicine-ball push presses. For the meters on the rower, perform a 1,750/2,500-meter Echo bike or an 800-meter run.

Post loads to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today is a heavy day. Keep in mind that heavy is relative to each athlete's capacity and experience. Look back at your previous attempt to help navigate today’s workout. As long as you are working to your limits, you will benefit from this effort. Experienced athletes should build to a heavy set of 5 and plan to go as heavy as possible across all sets. Newer athletes should start light, focus on mechanics, and slowly add weight as they are comfortable.


**Scaling:**  
To adjust the complexity of the lift, consider performing the movement with a pair of dumbbells or performing shoulder presses.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider using a single dumbbell or kettlebell. If you are unable to add load, consider handstand push-ups, pike push-ups, or push-ups.


**Intermediate option:**

Compare to [220725.](https://www.crossfit.com/220725)  

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout combines a higher-level gymnastics skill with a conditioning effort. Your goal is to get through the L-sit holds in as few sets as possible and push the pace on each run. Choose a variation for the L-sit that allows you to hold for at least 10 seconds (longer in the beginning rounds). L-sit holds can be performed with whatever is available — a pair of boxes, a pair of heavier dumbbells or kettlebells, a pair of parallettes, or even on a pair of rings. Regardless of the variation you choose, hold yourself to a standard and try not to deviate throughout the workout.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of the run. Reduce the time component of the L-sit hold.

To reduce the complexity of the L-sit hold, start by bending one or both of your legs. If that is too challenging, try seated single-leg raise holds. And finally, consider plank holds.

In case of injury or limitation, for the 400-meter run, consider performing a 900/1,250-meter Echo bike or 400/500-meter row or ski erg.

**Intermediate option:**    
4 rounds for time of:

Post time to comments

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
This is a sprint workout that should be a balanced challenge of metabolic and muscular fatigue. The goal is to hang on to the barbell and move through each round in as few sets as possible. Look back at your previous score to help navigate today’s effort. The deadlifts should feel the easiest of the three movements. Your capacity with the hang power snatch and overhead squat will determine your load for the workout. Choose a weight that allows you to complete the entire workout in under 15 minutes. Advanced athletes should be able to keep each round to less than 1 minute. Have fun!

**Scaling:**  
Reducing the load of the barbell will decrease the difficulty of each movement, as well as the complexity.

In case of injury or limitation, consider using a dumbbell for the deadlifts and hang power snatches. If you have an overhead limitation, perform hang power cleans and front squats.

**Intermediate option:**    
10 rounds for time of:  
4 deadlifts

**Coaching cues:**  
Unless you are planning on performing the snatches immediately after the deadlifts, consider using a mixed grip on the deadlifts to save your grip. Then, put the barbell down briefly to adjust your grip before performing the hang power snatches.

Today’s workout consists of 5 all-out sprints on the rower. Attempt to improve upon your previous times if you know them. Don’t game anything here. Put your foot on the gas pedal from the start, and hang on for a wild ride. As a general guideline, consider scaling the distance if these efforts will exceed 2:30. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of the row in each set.

In case of injury or limitation, consider a 900/1,250-meter Echo bike or a 400-meter run in place of the row.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
5 rounds, each for time, of:   
**250**-meter row  

Rest 3 minutes between efforts.

**Coaching cues:**  
To increase stroke rate, when you reach the end of your pull, quickly extend your arms, then use your feet to pull your body forward and back into the next stroke.

"Friday 250704","**Triple Deuce**

As many rounds and reps as possible in 20 minutes of:  
22 burpees  
22 air squats  
22 pull-ups  
22 sandbag ground-to-over-the-shoulders  
722-meter run

♀ 40-lb sandbag  
♂ 60-lb sandbag

Post rounds and reps to comments.

Army Sgt. 1st Class Jamie Nicholas, Army Sgt. 1st Class Gary Vasquez, and Army Capt. Richard Cliff, Jr., assigned to the 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, died Sept. 29, 2008, in Yakhchal, Afghanistan, from wounds sustained when their vehicle encountered an improvised explosive device during mounted operations.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
This Hero workout will test cardiorespiratory endurance and stamina, where completing 3 or more rounds is a general guideline to follow. Since this is a Hero workout, feel free to attempt it as prescribed, even if 3 rounds may not be within reach. The air squats can be performed quickly, while the burpees and pull-ups may need some pacing to be able to complete them at a consistent pace. The sandbag is intended to be light so 22 reps can be completed with minimal rest between each. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the sandbag. Reduce the reps of the movements. Reduce the distance of the run.

To reduce the complexity of the burpees, perform up-downs. For the pull-ups, consider performing jumping pull-ups or ring rows. For the sandbag ground-to-over-the-shoulders, perform dumbbell power cleans, hang power cleans, or even light medicine-ball cleans over the shoulder

In case of injury or limitation, perform a 1,750/2,500-meter Echo bike or 800/1,000-meter row in place of the 722-meter run. For the air squats, consider squatting to a target that allows for a pain-free range of motion.

"Wednesday 250702","**Part 1**  
In 10 minutes:  
Establish a 2-rep-max shoulder press

3 minutes rest

**Part 2**  
As many calories as possible in 10 minutes of:  
Echo bike

Post to comments:  
1. Max weight lifted on the shoulder press in pounds  
2. Total calories completed on the bike  
3. Total weight + calories

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
This two-part workout will test upper-body pressing strength, as well as general conditioning. Start at a light load in the shoulder press and build up quickly to establish a 2-rep max for the day with sound mechanics. New athletes can focus on mechanics and keep the loads sub-maximal. Ten minutes on the bike will feel like a LONG TIME where you are at your threshold for a large portion of the workout. Set a goal cadence to maintain and treat the last minute as a final sprint to the finish. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the time on the Echo bike in Part 2.

To reduce the complexity of the shoulder presses, consider using a pair of dumbbells. This will eliminate the need to navigate the head and reduce the complexity of the rack position.

In case of injury or limitation, perform bench presses or floor presses in place of the shoulder presses. If necessary, consider single-dumbbell shoulder presses. For the max calories in Part 2, use any machine available.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
Same as Rx’d.

**Coaching cues:**   
Keep your abdominals, glutes, and quadriceps tight throughout the shoulder press to reduce issues of overextending the trunk.

♀ 35-lb kettlebells  
♂ 53-lb kettlebells

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Expect this conditioning workout to challenge the trunk and legs, as well as the skill of the rope climb. The GHD sit-up volume is reasonable, but expect this movement to increase the difficulty of the knee raise component of the rope climbs, as well as the core demands of the kettlebell front-rack walking lunges. The load of the kettlebells is intended to be moderate, where the initial round can be completed unbroken or with one break. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the kettlebells. Reduce the reps of the GHD sit-ups and rope climbs.

To reduce the complexity of the GHD sit-ups, reduce the range of motion. For the rope climbs, reduce the height of the climb. For the kettlebell front-rack lunges, perform the lunges with a single kettlebell or hold the two kettlebells in the farmers carry position.

In case of injury or limitation, perform sit-ups or V-ups in place of the GHD sit-ups. For the rope climbs, perform pull-to-stands. For the kettlebell front-rack lunges, eliminate the loading or consider step-ups to a low box.

**Intermediate option:**

**Coaching cues:**  
Treat the rope climb as a stand or squat after securing the wrap instead of pulling with the arms. In the warm-up, practice establishing a secure foot hook before standing up and reaching for the next pull. This will reduce the risk of unnecessary foot sliding as you are climbing.

400-meter run  
30 clean and jerks  
200-meter run

♀ 95 lb  
♂ 135 lb

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
This chipper combines the classic benchmark workout Grace, alongside 600 total meters of running. This is intended to be a short effort with a fast pace in mind. The load on the clean and jerks is intended to be moderate and allow for some small unbroken sets combined with consistent singles performed with minimal rest between reps. Advanced athletes can storm through this workout at a blistering pace and attempt to complete it in around 5-6 minutes. Can anyone complete this in sub-5 minutes?

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the distance of each run.

To reduce the complexity of the clean and jerk, consider performing a hang clean and jerk with a barbell or a pair of dumbbells.

In case of injury or limitation, for the 400-meter run, perform 400/500 meters on the rower or ski erg, or 900/1,250 meters on the Echo bike. For the 200-meter run, perform 200/250 meters on the rower or ski erg, or 500/700 meters on the Echo bike. For the clean and jerks, if there is an overhead limitation, perform a power clean only. If there is a wrist limitation, use one or two dumbbells.

[What CrossFit Taught Me About Thinking](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-sugar-diet-thinking)  

When Mark Bell started promoting the ""Sugar Diet"" – a plan that involves eating only fruit, honey, and even candy – my first instinct was to dismiss it as nutritional lunacy. Sound familiar? It's the same knee-jerk reaction people have to CrossFit before they actually step into a gym. This isn't about whether the Sugar Diet works (I honestly don't know yet), but about something more important: how we evaluate ideas that challenge our beliefs.

10 box jumps  
10 deadlifts


Rest 1 minute between rounds.

♀ 24-inch box  
♂ 30-inch box

**Post-Workout**  
Accumulate 3 minutes of an L-sit in as few sets as possible.

Post time for each interval and load used on the deadlifts to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Each effort of this interval workout is intended to be short with a rest period that won’t allow for total recovery. The box jump height is intended to be challenging but allow for a consistent pace. The deadlift weight is up to you and can be changed as needed throughout the workout. The goal is to use a challenging load that allows for all 10 reps to be completed consecutively with sound mechanics. Expect the fatigue in the posterior chain to make each movement significantly more difficult in the later rounds. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the height of the box and the weight on the deadlift. 

To reduce the complexity of the box jumps, perform step-ups. For the post-workout skill work, reduce the length of the legs by bending the knees and tucking them in close to your chest.

In case of injury or limitation, for the deadlifts, to keep your torso more upright and avoid having to navigate the knees, consider sumo-stance kettlebell or dumbbell deadlifts. You may also choose unloaded good mornings. For the L-sit holds, perform seated leg raise holds or plank holds.

Post rounds and reps to comments.

McCoy “Topsy” Turner, a loved member of the CrossFit community and former Seminar Staff trainer, died by suicide on March 8, 2025, after suffering from complex post-traumatic stress. 

Turner served for 17 years in the Royal Navy, specializing as an exercise rehabilitation instructor. He was part of Operation Herrick when he served in Afghanistan before relocating to Bali and continuing his work in CrossFit education. Turner worked more than 250 Level 1 and Level 2 Seminars. 

Turner was known for his warmth and kindness, and touched countless lives who attended CrossFit courses. He is survived by his sons Brodie and Tommy.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
This Hero workout is a triplet where athletes can attempt to move at a consistent pace throughout the duration of the workout. The load on the thruster and the ring muscle-ups are intended to be completed unbroken. Row at a pace that allows for some recovery to allow for adequate performance on the remaining movement. Since this is a Hero workout, athletes can attempt it as prescribed even if the intended stimulus is not met. Embrace the challenge. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the reps of the ring muscle-ups. Reduce the calories on the rower.

To reduce the complexity of the ring muscle-ups, consider jumping ring muscle-ups.

In case of injury or limitation, consider performing low-ring muscle-up transitions for the ring muscle-up. If necessary, consider a combination of 2-3 ring rows and 2-3 push-ups from the knees. For the thrusters, perform front squats if you have an overhead limitation or push presses for a squat limitation. For the rower, consider performing the same calories on any available machine.

**Intermediate option:**    
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 25 minutes of:  
3 **jumping** ring muscle-ups  
8 thrusters

Helen is a classic benchmark known for being a simple workout that packs a potent punch. The rep scheme is intended to allow athletes to perform this workout at a fast pace with unbroken sets and minimal transition time between movements. Advanced athletes can challenge themselves to complete this workout in under 7 minutes. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the kettlebell. Reduce the distance of the run.

To reduce the demands of the pull-ups, consider reducing the reps to 6-8 or perform jumping pull-ups. For the kettlebell swings, reduce the range of motion and perform Russian kettlebell swings.

In case of injury or limitation, for the 400-meter run, perform 900/1,250 meters on the Echo bike or 400/500 meters on the rower. For the kettlebell swings, consider single-arm Russian kettlebell swings or kettlebell deadlifts. For the pull-ups, perform ring rows.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today is a heavy day. Keep in mind, heavy is relative to each athlete's capacity and experience. Look back at your previous attempt to help navigate today’s workout. As long as you are working to your limits, you will benefit from this effort. Experienced athletes should build to a heavy set of 2 and plan to go as heavy as possible across all sets. Newer athletes should start light, focus on mechanics, and slowly add weight as they are comfortable.

**Scaling:**  
To adjust the complexity of the lift, consider performing goblet squats with a dumbbell or kettlebell.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider squatting with a single dumbbell or kettlebell. You can also lunge with a load or perform an unloaded air squat.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s effort is a chipper-style workout that could extend into the 15-minute time domain, while advanced athletes can push to finish in under 12 minutes. Attempt to move at a fast pace on the double-unders while the ring dips, step-ups, and burpees will be more of a slower grind. Consider breaking the ring dips up early to avoid muscular failure and attempt to maintain a steady and consistent pace on the step-ups and burpees. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the dumbbells and the height of the box. Reduce the reps of each movement. Consider 30 reps of each movement.

To reduce the complexity of the jump rope, perform 1 minute of double-under attempts for each set or perform single-unders. For the ring dips, perform jumping ring dips or foot-assisted ring dips.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing 10 calories on any machine in place of the jump rope. For the ring dips, consider banded ring dips, box dips, or push-ups. For the burpees, consider performing up-downs. For the dumbbell box step-ups, perform step-ups with no weight.

[Squat Smarter: How Biomechanics Reveal Your Hidden Weaknesses](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-squat-biomechanics-zlong)  

Think all squats are created equal? Think again. The subtle differences in where you place that barbell — behind your back, across your shoulders, or overhead — completely transform how your body moves, what muscles work hardest, and where you're most likely to hit a wall. Whether you're missing front squats because your upper back gives out before your legs, struggling with overhead squats despite crushing back squats, or wondering why your ankle mobility matters more in some variations than others, understanding these biomechanical differences is the key to unlocking your squat potential and training smarter.

12 dumbbell deadlifts  
9 dumbbell hang power cleans  
6 dumbbell shoulder-to-overheads  

♀ 35-lb dumbbells  
♂ 50-lb dumbbells

Post time to comments.

Compare to [240712.](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2024/07/12)  

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout should look familiar. This is a dumbbell variation of the Hero workout DT. The loading of the dumbbells should be on the lighter side of moderate and allow you to perform all 27 reps in 3 sets or less. More advanced athletes should try to maintain unbroken reps for as many rounds as possible, while less-experienced athletes should consider strategic breaks to keep moving through the rounds. For example, perform 11 deadlifts, then break. After a quick breath, perform your 12th deadlift and move right into 8 hang power cleans before breaking. After a quick breath, perform your last hang power clean and finish the round by completing 6 shoulder-to-overheads. Look back at your previous score to help you navigate today’s effort.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the dumbbells.

To reduce the complexity of the movements, perform each with a single dumbbell.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing unloaded good mornings in place of the deadlifts. Perform jumping squats for the hang power cleans, and push-ups for the shoulder-to-overheads.

**Intermediate option:**    
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 10 minutes of:  
12 dumbbell deadlifts

[Burst vs. Sustainable Power: Why CrossFit Trains Both Types of Strength](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-burst-sustainable-power)  

Can you jump higher than you can sustain a long met-con? If you're crushing your max clean and jerk but dying in Helen, you're experiencing the fascinating divide between burst power and sustainable power — two completely different athletic qualities that require different training approaches. Most people think power is just power, but the truth is far more nuanced. Understanding why your 40-inch vertical jump means nothing if you can't complete Fight Gone Bad will revolutionize how you think about CrossFit programming and why we need both crushing heavy days and lung-burning met-cons to build true, real-world fitness.

20 GHD sit-ups  
2 rope climbs to 15 feet

Post rounds and reps to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a sneaky couplet. Expect the GHD sit-ups to make the rope climbs a bit more difficult than they might normally be. If you have limited experience with the GHD, reduce the range of motion and reduce reps. If you do not have a GHD, check below for alternatives. For the rope climbs, only go up if you are confident you can complete the rep safely. Have fun with this workout and remember to be intentional with your foot hook in anticipation of accumulated fatigue.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps of the GHD sit-ups and rope climbs.

To reduce the demand of the GHD sit-ups, reduce the range of motion to parallel or a quarter. For the rope climbs, reduce the height of the climb.

In case of an injury or limitation, perform V-ups or AbMat sit-ups in place of the GHD sit-ups. For the rope climbs, consider pull-to-stands or strict pull-ups.

**Intermediate option:**

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is an opportunity to lift heavy. Keep in mind, heavy is relative to each individual's capacity and competence with the lift. Look back at your previous score to help you navigate today’s effort. The goal is to lift your heaviest load for each 5-minute section. Keep in mind, this is 15 minutes of continuous work without designated rest between segments. You can increase the loading across each minute, maintain the same weight for multiple sets, or stay at one weight for the entire workout. Newer and less-experienced athletes should focus on refining technique at submaximal loads rather than increasing the weight throughout the workout.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell to maintain the integrity of the lift.

To reduce the complexity of the lift, reduce the loading, and consider performing a hang power snatch to avoid having to navigate the knees.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing a power clean for an overhead limitation. You can also perform single-arm snatches with a dumbbell or kettlebell.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**

**Coaching cues:**  
As you cycle the barbell, focus on pressing the hips back, pulling the barbell into the body, and brushing the thighs as the barbell returns to the floor.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the medicine ball. Reduce the distance of each run.

To reduce the complexity of the wall-ball shots, lower the height of the target and reduce the loading of the medicine ball.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a 1,750/2,500-meter Echo bike or 800/1,000-meter row in place of the 800-meter run. For the 400-meter run, perform 900/1,250-meter Echo bike or 400/500-meter row. For the 200-meter run, perform a 500/700-meter Echo bike or 200/250-meter row.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a triplet. The goal is to move through this workout in 15 minutes or less. The loading of the barbell should be moderate and allow you to perform your reps in 2 sets or fewer. For the double-unders, spend no more than 2 minutes accumulating your reps or practicing this exercise. Coming off the Community Cup workouts, adjust today’s workout based on how you are feeling (soreness, recovery status, and overall ability to push).

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the reps of the double-unders and burpees.

To reduce the complexity of the double-unders, perform 90 seconds to 2 minutes of double-under attempts or single-unders. For the bar-facing burpees, consider regular burpees or up-downs.

In case of injury or limitation, perform 15/20 calories on the Echo bike in place of the double-unders. For the deadlifts, to keep your torso more upright and avoid having to navigate the knees, consider sumo-stance kettlebell or dumbbell deadlifts. You may also choose unloaded good mornings.

Push the pace on the run only if you can maintain unbroken back squats. Otherwise, use this run as “recovery.” If you are planning on performing the Community Cup workouts, consider reducing the loading in today’s workout, focusing on quality of movement, and preparing for the week ahead.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell.

To reduce the complexity of the back squats, consider performing goblet squats with a dumbbell or kettlebell.

In case of injury or limitation, perform 400/500 meters on the rower or ski erg, or 900/1,250 meters on the Echo bike. For the back squats, consider air squats to a target that allows for a pain-free range of motion.

**Intermediate option:**    
4 rounds for time of:  
400-meter run  
10 **¾-bodyweight** back squats

**Beginner option:**   
4 rounds for time of:  
**200**-meter run  
10 back squats

♀ **35-lb barbell**   
♂ **45-lb barbell**

**Coaching cues:**  
In the descent of the back squat, focus on sending your hips back and down while trying to “screw” your feet into the ground.

Post time to comments.

Compare to [210420.](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2021/04/20)  

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a benchmark workout called G.I. Jane. If you have completed this workout before, look back at your previous score to help you navigate today’s effort. This workout is all about mental fortitude and your ability to endure the monotony of the task in front of you. There is nothing fancy here — just “fall” to the floor, get up, and get your chin over the pull-up bar. Your legs are your best friend when it comes to these pull-ups. Use them to jump your chin up over the bar. Choose a height for your pull-up bar that allows you to keep moving. When in doubt, lower the pull-up bar and go faster.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps and/or the height of the pull-up bar.

To reduce the complexity of the burpee, consider performing an up-down. For the pull-up portion of the movement, reduce the height of the pull-up bar to allow yourself the opportunity to jump your chin over the bar.

In case of injury or limitation, perform burpees or up-downs with a jump to touch the pull-up bar (instead of performing the pull-up).

**Intermediate option:**   
For time:  
**70** burpee pull-ups

Jump to a pull-up bar **6 inches** above your reach.

**Beginner option:**   
For time:  
50 burpee pull-ups

Jump to a pull-up bar **at the middle of your forearms when your arms are extended overhead.**

**Coaching cues:**  
Draw a line on the floor directly underneath the pull-up bar. On each burpee, place your hands on this line and focus on jumping your feet to your hands. This will position you in the best spot to jump to your bar.

Post reps to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is essentially three 4-minute efforts. Two of these efforts are Tabata double-unders and the couplet is a 4-minute AMRAP (as many reps as possible). Your score today is total reps. The loading of the dumbbell should be relatively light and allow you to complete your reps unbroken. Choose an option for the single-leg squats that allows you to keep moving.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the dumbbell.

To reduce the complexity of the double-unders, perform single-unders. For the single-leg squats, consider performing single-leg squats to a target or single-leg squats with the non-squatting leg wrapped around the heel of the squatting leg.

In case of injury or limitation, perform calories on any available machine in place of the double-unders. For the dumbbell hang snatches, perform dumbbell hang cleans (overhead limitation). For the single-leg squats, consider reverse lunges or air squats.

**Intermediate option:**

♀ 145 lb

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is just you and a barbell. This is meant to be a heavy conditioning effort. While the deadlifts will be the “easiest” part of the workout, each movement will continue to get more difficult. Manage your reps and your pace accordingly. Beware of “sprinting” through the deadlifts. A fatigued posterior can create trouble in the movements that follow. Today is a great day to work with a load that is challenging, as long as the safety and integrity of the movements are maintained. Have fun!

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell.

To reduce the complexity of the hang squat cleans, consider breaking the movement into a hang power clean and then a front squat. For all of these movements, using a single dumbbell or pair of dumbbells would reduce the complexity.

In case of injury or limitation, perform any or all of the movements with a single dumbbell or kettlebell.

1,600/2,000-meter row

Every 90 seconds, including the start, perform 3 wall walks until  you complete the row.

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a single distance on the rower. However, every 90 seconds, including at the start, you have to perform a task: wall walks. Continue this until the distance on the rower is completed. This effort should take 15 minutes or less to complete. With every precious second, push the pace on the rower. Choose a movement for the wall walks that allows you to finish your reps in 30 seconds or less.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance on the rower. Reduce the reps of the wall walks.

To reduce the complexity of the wall walks, shorten the range of motion. Consider taking only 2-3 steps toward the wall and returning to the start.

In case of injury or limitation, perform 3,500/5,000 meters on the Echo bike or run 1,600 meters. For the wall walks, perform an inchworm, plus a push-up from the knees.

**Intermediate option:**

5 thrusters  
10 toes-to-bars  
15 burpees  

♀ 115 lb  
♂ 165 lb

Post rounds and reps to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a triplet with a heavier long-range-of-motion weightlifting movement. Yes, the thruster weight should be challenging, but you should be able to perform your reps unbroken in every round. You may have to rest following the burpees, but you should go unbroken when you pick the barbell up. Manage your pace on the toes-to-bars and burpees to minimize “extended” breaks and long gazes at the barbell.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell.

To reduce the complexity of the toes-to-bars, shorten the range of motion. Consider knees-to-chests or hanging knee raises. For the burpees, consider reducing the reps or performing up-downs.

In case of injury or limitation, perform dumbbell thrusters, push presses (squat limitation), or front squats (overhead limitation) in place of the thrusters. For the toes-to-bars, consider V-ups or sit-ups.

Today’s workout is a classic CrossFit benchmark and is meant to be completed relatively quickly. The goal is to complete the work in 10 minutes or less. The cleans can be performed as either squat cleans or power cleans. Decide which technique you’ll use before you start, then stick with it. If you have completed this workout in the past, use your previous score to help you navigate today’s effort.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell.

To reduce the complexity of the ring dips, consider jumping ring dips or foot-assisted ring dips. For the cleans, perform hang power cleans.

In case of injury or limitation, perform single-dumbbell cleans. For the ring dips, consider push-ups or bench/box dips.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the dumbbells. Reduce the calories on the rower and the height of the box.

To reduce the complexity of the box jumps, perform step-ups. For the farmers carries, consider using one dumbbell.

In case of injury or limitation, perform the calories on any machine available. For the dumbbell farmers carries, consider hanging from a pull-up bar.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a classic lifting day to follow yesterday's longer effort. Depending on how you feel, use today as an opportunity to work on technique or to lift something relatively heavy. The repetitions in each set do not have to be touch-and-go. You may regrip and take no more than 10 seconds to perform the second lift. The snatch in today’s effort can be performed as a power or squat variation. Newer athletes should focus on developing consistently sound mechanics before adding weight.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell.

To reduce the complexity of the movements, consider performing hang power or hang squat snatches.

In case of injury or limitation, perform dumbbell snatches. If there is an overhead limitation, perform cleans instead.

Today’s workout was created in 2005 in memory of Navy Lt. Michael Murphy, 29, of Patchogue, New York, who was killed in Afghanistan on June 28, 2005. This workout was one of Murphy’s favorites, and he’d named it “Body Armor.” It is now referred to as “Murph” in honor of the focused warrior and great American who wanted nothing more in life than to serve this great country and the beautiful people who make it what it is.

Compare to [240527.](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2024/05/27)  

**Stimulus and Strategy:**   
By design, most Hero workouts are meant to be extremely grueling, arduous, and mentally challenging. Many contain a very high volume of reps. Keep in mind that “challenging” is relative, and athletes should adjust workouts to align with their physical and psychological tolerances. If you are performing Murph, partition the pull-ups, push-ups, and squats as needed. Consider 20 sets of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats, or 10 rounds of 10 pull-ups, 20 push-ups, and 30 air squats. If you have completed Murph previously, consider performing the pull-ups, push-ups, and air squats unpartitioned. Beginner athletes should reduce the work to a level that is attainable yet challenging.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the repetitions of the pull-ups, push-ups, and air squats. Reduce the distance of each run.

To reduce the complexity of the pull-up, consider ring rows. For the push-ups, perform this movement from the knees or with your hands on a 30-inch box. For the air squats, perform this movement to a target that allows for a pain-free range of motion.

In case of injury or limitation, perform 1,600/2,000 meters on a rower (this should be a last resort) or 3,500/5,000 meters on an Echo bike.

Athletes who want to push the pace could certainly complete around 6 rounds. Work hard today and have fun.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the dumbbells. Reduce the distance of the handstand walk.

To reduce the complexity of the handstand walk, perform shoulder taps in the pike position or perform bear crawls. For the dumbbell step-overs, reduce the height of the box.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a 500/700-meter Echo bike or a 200-meter run. For the dumbbell step-overs, perform this movement with no weight and reduce the height of the box.

**Intermediate option:**    
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 12 minutes of:  
200/250-meter row      
20 shoulder taps **in the pike position**  
10 dumbbell box step-overs  
20 shoulder taps **in the pike position**

♀ **15**-lb dumbbells and a **20**-inch box  
♂ **25**-lb dumbbells and a **24**-inch box

**Beginner option:**   
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 12 minutes of:  
200/250-meter row  
25-foot **bear crawl**   
10 **box step-overs**  
25-foot **bear crawl**

♀ **12**-inch box  
♂ **20**-inch box

**Coaching cues:**  
During the handstand walk, think about pushing your hands into the floor and touching your toes to the ceiling.

"Friday 250523","5 rounds for time of:  
15 GHD back extensions  
25 AbMat sit-ups  
50 double-unders

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is all about the midline. Expect all three movements to offer their own challenge. The GHD back extensions focus on targeting your ability to isolate your spinal erectors and abdominals as you move your body through space. The AbMat sit-ups isolate the abdominals and hip flexors (depending on how you position your legs). The double-unders will challenge your ability to resist the urge to bend at the hips and disrupt a stable midline. Focus on quality of movement versus rushing and moving with poor form. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps of the back extensions, AbMat sit-ups, and double-unders.

To reduce the complexity of the GHD back extensions, perform GHD hip extensions or 30- to 45-second GHD Superman holds. For the double-unders, work on double-under attempts or single-unders for 1 minute. 

In case of injury or limitation, perform a lightly loaded or unloaded good morning in place of the GHD back extensions. For the AbMat sit-ups, accumulate 30-second to 1-minute plank holds. For the double-unders, consider a 500/700-meter Echo bike or 200/250-meter row.

**Intermediate option:**    
5 rounds for time of:  
**10** GHD back extensions  
**20** AbMat sit-ups  
**30** double-unders

**Beginner option:**   
5 rounds for time of:  
**20-second GHD superman hold**  
**10** AbMat sit-ups  
**30 single**-unders

**Coaching cues:**  
On the GHD back extensions, focus on starting and finishing the movement with your chin. At the start of the movement, the chin tucks toward the chest, then each vertebra follows after. To finish the movement, extend each vertebra, then bring the chin back to its neutral position.

[Nutrition 101: Part 3 – Carbohydrates](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/nutrition-101-part-3-carbohydrates)  

Carbohydrates give you quick fuel. Think of them as your body's gasoline. Simple carbs (like sugar in candy and fruit) give you fast energy that doesn't last long, while complex carbs (like those in whole grains and vegetables) provide slower, longer-lasting fuel. However, unlike protein (which provides essential amino acids) and fat (which provides essential fatty acids), there are no essential carbohydrates. Read on to find out why.

Compare to [240531.](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2024/05/31)  

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
In today’s workout, moving this moderately heavy barbell is going to get way more metabolic than you want it to. Use a load that allows you to complete the hang power cleans in 1-3 sets and the front squats in 1-2 sets throughout the entire workout. Breaks are expected, but the goal is to keep marching forward and maintain at least 1 round every 2 minutes. If you completed this workout previously, use that score to help you navigate today’s effort.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the barbell.

To reduce the complexity of the hang power cleans and front squats, use a pair of dumbbells to complete both movements.

In case of injury or limitation, perform Russian kettlebell swings in place of the hang power cleans. For the front squats, perform goblet squats with a single kettlebell or dumbbell. If necessary, squat to an elevated target that allows for a pain-free range of motion.

**Intermediate option:**

♀ 50-lb dumbbell  
♂ 75-lb dumbbell

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout has three movements organized in a descending rep scheme. Aim to move through as quickly as possible while minimizing your breaks. The loading of the dumbbell should be moderate to heavy. This may require you to reset and switch hands with the dumbbell on the floor. Following the dumbbell snatches, pay attention to your grip on the toes-to-bars. If you break, count to five, then jump back up on the bar.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the dumbbell. Reduce the reps of the toes-to-bars and burpees.

To reduce the complexity of the toes-to-bars, reduce the range of motion. Consider performing knees-to-chests or hanging knee raises. For the dumbbell snatches, perform them from the hang position.

In case of injury or limitation, perform V-ups or AbMat sit-ups in place of the toes-to-bars. For the burpees, perform up-downs. For the dumbbell snatches, perform Russian kettlebell swings.

"Saturday 250517","4 rounds for time of:  
50 air squats  
15 shoulder-to-overheads

♀ 105-lb barbell  
♂ 155-lb barbell

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s couplet is sneaky. Never underestimate the air squat. Expect the compounding effect of the squats to make the shoulder-to-overheads more challenging. You may perform the first round of shoulder-to-overheads as a push press, then switch to a push jerk in the second round. Push the pace on the air squats, but not at the expense of good technique or your ability to pick up the barbell. Have fun today and don’t let the “little ol’ air squat” get the best of you.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps of the air squats. Reduce the volume and load of the barbell. 

To reduce the complexity of the shoulder-to-overheads, perform push presses or shoulder presses. If necessary, using dumbbells for this movement can also reduce the complexity.

In case of injury or limitation, perform the squats to an elevated target that allows for pain-free range of motion. You may also consider 250 meters on a rower or 700 meters on the Echo bike. For the shoulder-to-overheads, use a single dumbbell to perform the movement and alternate arms as you are able.

**Intermediate option:**    
4 rounds for time of:  
50 air squats  
15 shoulder-to-overheads

♀**75**-lb barbell  
♂ **115**-lb barbell

**10** shoulder-to-overheads

♀ **35**-lb barbell  
♂ **45**-lb barbell

**Coaching cues:**  
In today’s air squats, not every rep is going to be perfect. However, you should always strive to maintain the five key points of performance: heels down, neutral spine maintained, knees track in line with the toes, the hip descends back and down, and the hip crease gets below the top of the knee at the bottom.

♀ 155-lb barbell and a 24-inch box  
♂ 225-lb barbell and a 30-inch box

Post remaining time or remaining reps for each round to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a challenge, and making the movements appropriate to your skill level is key to getting the most out of this effort. The loading of the barbell should be moderate and allow you to perform the reps unbroken in every set. When you are thinking about scaling options, consider movements that allow you to complete each round of 3/6/9 in about 1 minute or less. Expect the box jumps to be the biggest speed bump in the equation. With this in mind, push the pace on each run to give yourself as much time as possible to complete the rounds in each interval. Expect the first interval to leave you with the most rest and the last interval to be the most challenging. It’s possible you won’t finish all 4 rounds of the final interval.

To calculate your score, keep track of your rest at the end of each interval. Then, add the three times together into one time. For example, if I have 1 minute of rest at the end of all three intervals, then my score is 3 minutes.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of each run. Reduce the volume of the bar muscle-ups and box jumps. Reduce the load of the barbell.

To reduce the complexity of the bar muscle-ups, perform a challenging pulling exercise such as jumping bar muscle-ups, chest-to-bar pull-ups, chin-over-bar pull-ups, or ring rows. For the box jumps, reduce the height of the box or perform step-ups.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a 500/700-meter Echo bike or 200/250-meter row in place of the 200-meter run. For the 400-meter run, perform a 900/1,250-meter Echo bike or 400/500-meter row. For the 800-meter run, perform a 1,750/2,500-meter Echo bike or 800/1,000-meter row. For the bar muscle-ups, consider a banded PVC pull-down. For the deadlifts, consider sumo deadlifts with a kettlebell or unloaded good mornings.

♀ 35-lb dumbbells  
♂ 50-lb dumbbells

Post rounds and reps to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
In today’s triplet, push the pace because before you know it, the workout will be over. Use a pair of dumbbells that allows you to stay quick and unbroken. The fatigue in your grip and legs from the lunges will try to slow you down. Take breaks where you need to, but try not to get too comfortable hook-gripping your shorts.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the dumbbells.

To reduce the complexity of the rope climbs, consider reducing the height of the climb or performing pull-to-stands. For the double-unders, spend no more than 30 seconds per round performing attempts or perform single-unders.

In case of injury or limitation, perform reverse lunges or a box step-up. For the rope climb, perform 3 strict pull-ups or 3 ring rows. For the double-unders, substitute with 5-8 calories on a machine of your choice.

**Intermediate option:**

Post times to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a weightlifting and monostructural couplet. Use caution when pushing the pace on the bike. That strategy may make the bench presses more difficult than necessary. Instead, adjust your pace to allow you to maintain bigger chunks of reps on the bench. The loading of the barbell should be moderate to heavy and allow you to maintain consistent sets of 5-7 reps. Avoid pushing to failure on the bench presses unless you have a spotter. If you do not have a spotter, take extra time to rest between sets and only perform reps you know you can complete.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading and volume of the barbell. Reduce the calories on the bike. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the bench presses, perform dumbbell bench presses or dumbbell floor presses.

In case of injury or limitation, perform the calories on any machine available. For the bench presses, perform single-arm dumbbell bench presses or push-ups.

Static holds challenge the stamina of our muscles and our drive to mentally overcome negative thoughts. Most athletes can maintain the structure of this workout. Choose static hold modifications that allow you to hold for 20-30 seconds at a time. Rest as needed between movements and sets.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the duration of the workout, or the duration of each hold.

To reduce the complexity of the handstand hold, consider holding a pike position with your feet on a box or the floor. For the L-sit hold, bending your knees will make the movement easier. For the chin-over-bar hold, consider using a band or putting your feet on a box.

In case of injury or limitation, hold one or two dumbbells overhead in place of the handstand hold. For the L-sit hold, perform a seated leg lift with one or both legs. For the chin-over-bar hold, use a pair of rings like you would to perform ring rows; pull the rings to your chest and hold at your chest.

**Intermediate option:**    
Complete as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes of:  
30-second **pike hold with feet on a box**  
30-second squat hold  
30-second L-sit hold with **knees bent**  
30-second chin-over-bar hold  

**Beginner option:**   
Complete as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes of:  
30-second **plank hold**  
30-second squat hold  
30-second **hollow body hold**  
30-second **dead hang hold**  

**Coaching cues:**  
In the squat hold, challenge yourself to hold an active position. This means finding a bottom position where your back is neutral, knees are in line with your toes, weight is balanced in your feet, and your hip crease is below your knees.

[How to Sprint in CrossFit: 3 Cues to Get You Across the Line Fast](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-how-to-sprint)  

In CrossFit, weightlifting enjoys near celebrity status. Yet sprinting, a primal movement pattern hardwired into our DNA that delivers comparable benefits in strength, stability, and neurological development, remains underutilized in programming. While coaches eagerly teach complex Olympic lifts, many shy away from speed drills. The good news? Mastering sprinting fundamentals is accessible to everyone and requires just three key technical elements. Wanna go fast? Read on.

"Saturday 250510","Every 5 minutes for 5 rounds:  
5 power snatches  
400/500-meter row

Rest with the remaining time in the interval.

Post loads and total round times.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**   
Today’s workout is a bit of a choose your own adventure. The snatch loading is totally up to you. That being said, the workout is designed to have some rest between each interval, so choose a weight that allows you to rest. You can go heavy and practice singles or cycling a heavier barbell, or you can go light and focus on technique or cycling a lighter weight. When you get to the rower, push the pace. If you are feeling “beat up” from yesterday’s workout, today can be more of a recovery/technique day.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the distance of the row.

To reduce the complexity of the snatch, consider a hang power snatch.

In case of injury or limitation, consider a 900/1,250-meter Echo bike or a 400-meter run. For the snatch, consider a dumbbell snatch or power clean if there is an overhead limitation.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
Every 5:00 for 5 rounds:  
5 power snatches

**Coaching cues:**  
During the first and second pulls of the snatch, focus on keeping the barbell close to your body as you pull your knees back and lift your shoulders at the same time. When you reach the mid-thigh position, your shoulders should be over the barbell with your arms long.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a classic benchmark, and with Murph right around the corner, what better way to prepare than to test Cindy. Look back to your previous attempt to help you navigate today’s effort. For most, push-ups become the crux of this workout. If this is you, manage your reps by taking breaks early and before you need to.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the volume of one or more movements to accommodate a limitation. Reduce the total time of the workout. This will limit the amount of volume accumulated.

To reduce the complexity of the pull-ups, consider reducing the total number of reps per round, or substituting with jumping pull-ups or ring rows. For the push-ups, consider performing reps from the knees or placing the hands on a 30-inch box.

In case of injury or limitation, consider performing single-arm ring rows or dumbbell bent-over rows for the pull-ups. For the push-ups, consider dumbbell floor presses. For the air squats, consider squatting to a target that allows for pain-free range of motion.

**Intermediate option:**

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
If executed properly, this workout challenges the boundaries of human performance and requires no equipment. It's a fantastic test of stamina, endurance, and mental fortitude. Experienced athletes should try for a PR on this benchmark effort. Look back at your previous time to help determine an appropriate pace. Newer athletes should reduce the distance to complete the run in no more than 20 minutes.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of the run.  
In case of injury or limitation, consider 11,200/16,000 meters on the Echo bike or 4,000/5,000 meters on the rower or SkiErg.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.
  
**Beginner option:**

Cleans  
Chest-to-wall strict handstand push-ups

♀ 155-lb barbell  
♂ 225-lb barbell

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a gymnastics and weightlifting couplet. The cleans are meant to be heavy, and the gymnastics movement is meant to be outside your comfort zone. These may be performed as power or squat cleans. You’ll likely perform singles on the cleans. If this is your first time seeing this handstand push-up variation, but you have strict handstand push-ups, use today to slow down, try something new and learn a new technique while being sure not to push past failure. If you do not have strict handstand push-ups, use some of the scaling options below.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the volume of the chest-to-wall strict handstand push-ups.

To reduce the complexity of the chest-to-wall strict handstand push-ups, consider performing deficit or regular strict handstand push-ups. If you are unable to perform strict handstand push-ups, consider piked push-ups or seated dumbbell shoulder presses. For the cleans, consider performing hang cleans.

In case of injury or limitation, perform dumbbell cleans in place of barbell cleans. For the wall-facing strict handstand push-ups, perform seated dumbbell shoulder presses.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a pyramid-style effort. Expect some interference from the box step-overs to the GHD sit-ups, as well as the bike. The core and lower body should be taxed. Aim to complete the workout in around 15 minutes or less.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the dumbbells. Reduce the volume of GHD sit-ups. Reduce the calories on the bike.

To reduce the complexity of the dumbbell box step-up overs, lower the height of the box or consider performing the movement with no weight. For the GHD sit-ups, reduce the range of motion, especially for those who have not been training consistently with this piece of equipment. 

In case of injury or limitation, perform the step-overs with no weight. For the GHD sit-ups, perform sit-ups or V-ups. For the Echo bike, perform calories on any machine available.

[Don’t Skip Speed Day: The Lost Art of Sprinting in CrossFit](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-speed-day)  

CrossFit’s foundation of broad, general, and inclusive fitness requires more than just met-cons and heavy lifts; it demands speed. This article explores why sprinting is just as essential as strength training in developing GPP. Drawing from Tony Leyland’s foundational work, we dig into the powerful physiological and neurological benefits of sprinting and its impact on sport and real-world performance. If you want to be a faster, stronger, and more resilient athlete, it’s time to start sprinting.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a classic CrossFit benchmark. Look back to your previous score to help you navigate today’s effort. Push to keep moving for as much of each minute as possible. Capitalize on movements you excel at and pace yourself on your weaker movements. If you have completed this workout before, don’t pace it. Give the first round a run for its money, and then hang on for the ride.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell and medicine ball.

Reduce the complexity of the wall-ball shots by lowering the height of the target. For the sumo deadlift high pulls, perform the movement with a kettlebell or dumbbell. For the box jumps, reduce the height of the box. For push presses, perform the movement with dumbbells.

In case of injury or limitation, use any machine available to perform calories. For the wall-ball shots, perform medicine-ball squats (overhead limitation). For the sumo deadlift high pulls, perform kettlebell or dumbbell sumo deadlifts or Russian kettlebell swings. For the box jumps, perform step-ups. For the push presses, perform single-arm dumbbell push presses or shoulder presses.

3 kettlebell snatches, left arm  

♀ 35-lb kettlebell  
♂ 53-lb kettlebell

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Think of today as a bit of a skill day. While some athletes may be able to move more quickly than others, expect the strict muscle-ups to inevitably slow you down — not to mention the movement interference when paired with the kettlebell snatch. Choose an option for the strict muscle-ups that allows you to practice where you need improvement. For some, this may be strength, while for others, this may be the transition portion of the movement. Slow it down, focus on the technique, and have some fun.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the kettlebell. For those who have strict ring muscle-ups but do not have the volume for today, reduce the number of reps to as few as 1 in each round.

To reduce the complexity of the ring muscle-ups, perform low-ring muscle-up transitions. Adjust the difficulty of this movement by using your feet as needed. For the kettlebell snatches, perform the movement with a dumbbell or perform single-arm Russian kettlebell swings.

In case of injury or limitation, the ring muscle-up transitions can be performed with a single arm. However, this will require more support from your legs. So, move yourself into a position that allows you to use more legs.

**Intermediate option:**    
9 rounds for time of:  
**1** strict muscle-up  
3 kettlebell snatches, right arm

[The Most Overlooked Key to Athletic Performance: GPP in CrossFit](https://youtu.be/lof6v82gQOQ) 

General physical preparedness (GPP) is often the most overlooked element in athletic training, but it’s the foundation of CrossFit’s methodology. Recently, Stephane Rochet (CF-L3) and Joe Alexander (CF-L4) did a deep dive into how effective GPP can elevate performance across all levels, from everyday athletes to Olympians. Drawing on years of experience, they discuss how CrossFit develops unmatched GPP, why fixing foundational deficiencies often yields immediate sport-specific benefits, and how prioritizing GPP can actually reduce injuries and training volume while increasing long-term athletic development. This is essential viewing for anyone who wants to truly understand the goal of CrossFit training and why it’s different than any other fitness methodology out there.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a 3-round triplet reminiscent of the benchmark workout Helen. Aim to hang on to the dumbbells and go unbroken for as many sets as possible. Unlike Helen, the run is last because it will force you to push the pace on the final round.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the dumbbells. Reduce the distance of the run.

To reduce the complexity of the squat cleans, perform hang dumbbell squat cleans. For the toes-to-bars, reduce the range of motion by bringing the knees up to the armpits or the chest.

In case of injury or limitation, for the 400-meter run, perform 900/1,250 meters on the Echo bike or 400/500 meters on the rower. For the dumbbell squat cleans, consider single-dumbbell squat cleans, power cleans, or goblet squats. For the toes-to-bars, perform V-ups or sit-ups.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today is a heavy day. As always, heavy is relative to each athlete's capacity and experience. You will benefit from today's effort if you work to your limits. Experienced athletes should build to a heavy set of 5 and plan to go as heavy as possible across all sets. Newer athletes should start light, focus on mechanics, and slowly add weight as they are comfortable.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell as needed to maintain consistently sound mechanics. If you are unable to achieve a sound setup with the barbell on the floor, consider lifting from an elevated surface.

To adjust the complexity of the lift, consider performing a sumo deadlift, or deadlift with a pair of kettlebells or dumbbells.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing good mornings or GHD hip extensions.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**

40 burpees  
200 double-unders

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a couplet with a higher volume of reps in each round. The goal is to maintain a consistent pace throughout both movements and avoid “hitting the wall.” Coming out hot on the burpees does you no good if you end up crawling to the finish line. Aim to complete a single round in 7 minutes or less.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps of both the burpees and the double-unders to hit the stimulus of the workout.

To reduce the complexity of the burpees, perform up-downs. For the double-unders, perform 2-3 minutes of double-under attempts or single-unders.

In case of injury or limitation, perform burpees or up-downs to a raised surface (e.g., a bench or a box). For the double-unders, consider 500 meters on a rower or 1,000 meters on an Echo bike per round.

**Intermediate option:**

[Why CrossFit Loves Hyrox (and Why That’s a Good Thing)](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-vs-hyrox)  

Lately, there's been a buzz about Hyrox possibly overtaking CrossFit as the next big thing in fitness — and as someone who's lived and breathed CrossFit for years, I've got some thoughts. Spoiler alert: They're not the same, and that's a good thing. This isn’t a battle. It’s a brilliant intersection. Here's my take on how Hyrox and CrossFit can — and should — thrive side by side.

"Saturday 250426","3 rounds for time of:  
7 wall walks  
14 front squats  
21 kettlebell swings

♀ 115-lb barbell, 53-lb kettlebell  
♂ 165-lb barbell, 70-lb kettlebell

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a triplet focused on stamina with a moderate-to-heavy load. Go into each set trying to perform reps unbroken. However, the goal is to choose a weight that allows you to complete both the front squats and kettlebell swings in one to two sets. All athletes should aim to complete a single round in 4 minutes or less.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the volume of wall walks, and the loading of the barbell and kettlebell.

Reduce the complexity of the wall walks by reducing the range of motion. If necessary, athletes can also perform inchworms with a push-up. For the kettlebell swings, perform Russian kettlebell swings.

In case of injury or limitation, perform back squats, goblet squats, or air squats in place of the front squats. For the kettlebell swings, consider single-arm kettlebell swings or kettlebell deadlifts.

**Intermediate option:**    
3 rounds for time of:  
**4** wall walks   
14 front squats  
21 kettlebell swings

14 front squats  
21 **Russian** kettlebell swings

♀ **35**-lb barbell, **18**-lb kettlebell  
♂ **45**-lb barbell, **26**-lb kettlebell

**Coaching cues:**  
On the wall walks, focus on keeping your hips over your shoulders as you walk back to the wall. Taking smaller steps with your hands can help with this. Then, as you get more confident, increase the length of your steps to reduce the cycle time of reps.

150-foot dumbbell farmers carry

♀ 35-lb dumbbells, 20-inch box  
♂ 50-lb dumbbells, 24-inch box

Post times to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a longer effort. Expect this to be more of a grind rather than a sprint through each round. Most athletes should aim to complete around three to four rounds. Choose a load for the dumbbells that allows you to maintain unbroken overhead walks, front-rack carries, and farmers carries.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the dumbbells, the distance of the carries, and the volume of AbMat sit-ups and box step-ups.

To reduce the complexity of the chest-to-bar pull-ups, perform a chin-over-bar pull-up, a jumping chest-to-bar pull-up, or a ring row. As for the box step-ups, reduce the height of the box or perform alternating lunges.

In case of injury or limitation, perform single-arm ring rows in place of the chest-to-bar pull-ups. For the AbMat sit-ups, perform plank holds for 30 seconds to 1 minute. If there is an overhead limitation, perform a second front-rack carry or farmers carry.

[CrossFit Makes You Athletic? Here’s Why That’s a Lie (And Why It Still Matters)](https://www.crossfit.com/efficacy/fitness-vs-athleticism)  

Everyone loves to argue over whether CrossFit creates athletes — or just really fit humans. Scroll through social media, and you’ll find hot takes, call-outs, and reaction videos claiming CrossFit athletes are just pretending to be athletic. But the truth is far less sexy and way more powerful: CrossFit doesn’t teach you to sink three-pointers or master a tennis serve, but it does build the raw physical capacity — the strength, speed, balance, and stamina — that fuels athletic greatness. So, let’s cut through the noise and finally settle it: What does CrossFit really do, and what are we actually training for?

Compare to [210603.](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2021/06/03)  

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a classic benchmark containing a high volume of a light weightlifting movement. If you have completed this workout before, be sure to look back at your score to help you navigate today’s effort. Choose a load that allows you to hang on for large sets. Pacing and strategic rest periods will be required to log your best time.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the total number of reps. Reduce the weight of the medicine ball.

To reduce the complexity of the wall-ball shot, consider reducing the height of the target. You may also consider performing thrusters with a light pair of dumbbells.

In case of injury or limitation, perform dumbbell front squats for an overhead limitation or dumbbell push presses for a squat limitation.

**Intermediate option:**    
For time:  
150 wall-ball shots

For time:  
**75** wall-ball shots  

♀ **6**-lb ball to 9-foot target  
♂ **10**-lb ball to **9**-foot target

**Coaching cues:**  
In each wall-ball shot, focus on pulling yourself to the bottom of each rep versus “falling” or collapsing to the bottom of the squat. This means actively thinking about screwing your feet into the ground and pulling the hips down to the bottom of the squat (hip crease below parallel).

Post loads to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a heavy day. Heavy is relative to each athlete. Each set is meant to be completed unbroken and in a touch-and-go fashion. Resting at the hips or the rack position is OK. Increase the weight across each set as long as technique and safety are maintained. Rest as needed between sets.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell to maintain the safety and integrity of the lifts.

Use dumbbells to decrease the complexity of the movements.

In case of injury or limitation, perform the lift with a single dumbbell. The lift can also be broken down into bodyweight movements like hip extensions and box jumps.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**  
Same as Rx’d.

**Coaching cues:**  
Focus on finishing the pull of each lift (aka, getting as tall as possible). James Brown said it best: “You gotta get up to get down.”

1,000-meter row

Compare to [110527.](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2011/05/27)  

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a classic chipper-style workout and a repeat from the 2011 CrossFit Regionals season. Push the pace on the run, but only as fast as you can get to the handstand push-ups and get to work immediately. The row following the handstand push-ups should be an “all-out” effort to get this workout across the finish line. Work hard and have fun today!

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of both the run and the row, and the volume of the handstand push-ups.

To reduce the complexity of the handstand push-ups, first begin by cutting the number of reps. Use this option if you have handstand push-ups, but the volume in this workout is too much — consider 10-20 reps. If you are not able to do handstand push-ups, consider pike push-ups or dumbbell push presses.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider substituting the run with a 1,750/2,500-meter Echo bike or an 800/1,000-meter row. For the row, consider substituting with a 1,750/2,500-meter Echo bike or a 1,000-meter run.

**Coaching cues:**  
If you are kipping your handstand push-ups today, focus on keeping your hips on the wall while you bring your knees toward your chest. If you want to keep your reps quick, don’t bring your knees down too far. If you need more momentum from your legs, bring your knees down further.

[When to Take Your Foot Off the Gas in CrossFit](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/taking-foot-off-the-gas-crossfit)  

CrossFit is built on the power of intensity — but there are moments when chasing the clock isn’t the answer. Whether you're returning from injury, learning a new skill, refining technique, or developing a specific capacity like stamina, easing off the gas can actually accelerate your long-term progress. In this article, Stephane Rochet (CF-L3)  explores the critical times when dialing back intensity isn’t a step backward — it’s the smartest move you can make.

Post total time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is three intervals with descending rep schemes. The rest in between each interval should allow you to keep intensity high throughout the entire effort. Aim for big to unbroken sets of reps on both the pull-ups and burpees. The loading of the barbell should be light to moderate and allow you to perform some touch-and-go reps.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the reps of any of the movements.

To reduce the complexity of pull-ups, perform jumping pull-ups or ring rows. For the burpees, perform up-downs. For the power snatches, perform hang power snatches or dumbbell snatches.

In case of injury or limitation, perform single-arm ring rows or dumbbell rows for the pull-ups. For the power snatches, perform power cleans if there is an overhead limitation.

♀ 95 lb  
♂ 135 lb

Compare to [250107.](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2025/01/07)

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is just you and the barbell. This is also a repeat from earlier this year — look back at your score to help you better navigate today’s effort. The loading should feel moderate and allow you to perform at least 2 rounds unbroken. A short break between movements is totally fine, but some athletes may be able to finish the last push jerk, lower the bar to the back rack, and begin the back squats. If you follow the loading stimulus, the goal is to minimize rest and complete as many sets as possible unbroken. This workout should take less than 10 minutes. Some advanced athletes may be able to go sub-5. The barbell should come from the floor. Do not use a rack unless there is an injury or limitation.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the barbell to maintain the safety and integrity of each movement, including being able to get the barbell safely from the ground to the back rack even under fatigue.

Reduce the complexity of the push jerks by performing push presses or shoulder presses. Consider using dumbbells to reduce the complexity of both movements.

In case of injury or limitation, perform single-arm dumbbell push jerks or push presses, and dumbbell goblet squats. To eliminate the barbell, perform push-ups and air squats.

**Intermediate option:**    
5 rounds for time of:  
12 push jerks  
12 back squats

♂ **95** lb

**Beginner option:**

**Coaching cues:**  
Each squat in today’s workout can be done quickly, but make sure you are keeping your weight balanced about your feet. Move too quickly, and the weight may pull you into your toes. Slow it down, regain your balance and then increase the speed as you are able.

♂ 225 lb and a 24-inch box

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is an upside-down pyramid — the reps go down and then back up to finish. Don’t let the first set of box jumps dictate the rest of the workout. In other words, you want to move at a pace that still allows you to push through the exercises that follow. Come out too hot, and this workout becomes a struggle really quickly. Manage your reps on the deadlifts to allow for short breaks between sets. Consider rep schemes like 10/8/7/5 or 8/7/5/5/5. Dig deep as you prepare to go back up the other side of the pyramid. Just keep moving.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the reps of each movement.

To reduce the complexity of the box jumps, jump on a lower box (to preserve the jumping stimulus) or perform box step-ups. For the deadlifts, perform the lift with the bumper plates on an elevated surface.

In case of injury or limitation, for deadlifts, perform sumo deadlifts, or use dumbbells or a single kettlebell. If you do not have an Echo bike, use any machine you have available.

♀ 35-lb dumbbell  
♂ 50-lb dumbbell

Post rounds and reps to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**   
In today’s workout, the repetitions in each round are few enough that you can move through rounds relatively quickly. Aim for a single round to take no more than about 2 minutes. Try to go unbroken through as many sets as possible, however, as grip becomes an issue, break up the toes-to-bars as needed and manage your rest time.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the dumbbell and volume of the push-ups and toes-to-bars.

To reduce the complexity of the push-ups, consider performing push-ups from the knees or with the hands elevated to a 30-inch box. For the dumbbell snatches, consider performing hang dumbbell snatches. For the toes-to-bars, reduce the height of the toes or consider knees-to-chests or hanging knee raises. 

However, if you have toes-to-bars, but 10 reps per round is too many, reduce the reps to no less than 5. This is a great way to practice and develop the movement.

In case of injury or limitation, perform dumbbell cleans for the dumbbell snatches, dumbbell floor presses for the push-ups, and consider V-ups or sit-ups for the toes-to-bars.

**Intermediate option:**    
Complete as many rounds as possible in 10 minutes of:

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is simple and effective. All you need is a 400-meter track or running route. Push the pace on the run early because it's only a matter of time before your legs begin to feel like they are filled with concrete. As you are performing the lunges, focus on gently touching the back knee to the ground to protect your knees.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of the run and the walking lunges.

To reduce the complexity of the lunge, consider a box step-up or reverse lunge.

In case of injury or limitation, for the 350-meter run, perform 800/1,110 meters on the Echo bike or 350/450 meters on the rower.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a triplet with a descending rep scheme. The row is a trap unless you are confident in your bar muscle-ups. Most athletes should pace the row and focus on using the legs to save their pull for the muscle-ups. This is a great workout to practice skills like the double-under and the bar muscle-up. Consider reducing the reps or giving yourself a time cap for these elements.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps of the double-unders and bar muscle-ups.

To reduce the complexity of the double-unders, consider giving yourself 2 minutes to accumulate reps or perform single-unders. For the bar muscle-up, consider giving yourself 2-3 minutes to accumulate reps, performing a jumping bar muscle-up, or a challenging variation of a pull-up and dip.

In case of injury or limitation, perform the calories on any machine available. For the double-unders, perform low box step-ups (4 inches) and reduce the reps to 60/40/20. For the bar muscle-ups, consider ring rows or low-ring muscle-up transitions.

U.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Fernando Jorge, 39, of Cypress, California, an Aviation Survival Technician Chief, died on Feb. 28, 2012, when his unit's helicopter crashed into Mobile Bay in the Gulf of Mexico during a training mission. He is survived by his sister Gina.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today, we’re completing a CrossFit Hero workout. Expect this effort to be a grind. Choose a weight for the barbell that allows you to perform singles relatively quickly. As a gauge, your goal should be to perform at least 5 squat cleans in a minute. For the GHD sit-ups, if you are not familiar with this movement and consistently training on the GHD, reduce the reps and range of motion.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell.

To reduce the complexity of the GHD sit-ups, reduce the range of motion, or perform V-ups or sit-ups. For the squat cleans, consider hang squat cleans with a barbell or dumbbells.

In case of injury or limitation, for the squat cleans, consider single-dumbbell hang squat cleans or goblet squats. For the GHD sit-ups, perform sit-ups or plank shoulder taps.

**Intermediate option:**

[Efficient Training: The 80/20 Rule of Fitness and How CrossFit Maximizes Results with Minimal Time](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-80-20)  

The Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 rule, suggests that 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. CrossFit embodies this principle by focusing on high-intensity, functional movements, constant variance, and mixed-modality workouts to deliver maximum fitness gains efficiently. Unlike traditional training that prioritizes volume, CrossFit optimizes intensity to drive adaptation, ensuring long-term progress without excessive time investment. With proper nutrition as its foundation, CrossFit’s methodology enables athletes to achieve elite fitness levels in less time, leaving them more opportunities to enjoy life outside the gym.

♂ 50-lb dumbbells

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a couplet with a descending rep scheme. The runs get shorter and the reps of the push presses go down as well. The loading of the dumbbells should allow you to perform consistent sets of 10 throughout the entirety of the workout. Aim to complete this workout in 15 minutes or less.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of each run. Reduce the loading of the dumbbells.

To reduce the complexity of the dumbbell push presses, consider using a single dumbbell and alternating arms as needed, or performing dumbbell shoulder presses.

In case of injury or limitation, for the 800-meter run, perform 1,750/2,500 meters on the Echo bike or 800/1,000 meters on the rower. For the 400-meter run, perform 900/1,250 meters on the Echo bike or 400/500 meters on the rower. For the 200-meter run, 500/700 meters on the Echo bike, or 200/250 meters on the rower.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a double dose of Tabata — one weightlifting movement and one gymnastics movement. The goal is to move for as much of the 20 seconds as possible with minimal rest. The loading of the deadlift should be light to moderate. For the box jump-overs, consider stepping off the box before jumping into your next rep for safety. Following your last set of deadlifts, you have 10 seconds to transition to the first set of box jump-overs.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the deadlift. Reduce the height of the box.

To reduce the complexity of the box jump-overs, consider performing box step-overs.

In case of injury or limitation, perform sumo deadlifts or dumbbell deadlifts. For the box jump-overs, consider performing calories on any available machine.

Post total reps to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a repeat from January. This effort has a rep scheme like you would find in the benchmark Cindy. However, in this effort, you don’t have the upper-body pressing movement. Instead, we have a triplet that focuses on the midline and lower-body stamina. Choose options that allow you to perform a single round in 2 minutes or less.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the kettlebell to maintain unbroken goblet squats.

Reduce the complexity of the pull-ups by performing jumping pull-ups or ring rows. For the knees-to-elbows, perform knees-to-chests, hanging knee raises, or V-ups. First, look to reduce the load of the kettlebell, but if necessary, perform an air squat.

In case of injury or limitation, perform ring rows or single-arm ring rows. For the knees-to-elbows, perform V-ups, sit-ups, or plank holds. For the goblet squats, consider air squats or lunges.

**Intermediate option:**    
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 12 minutes of:  
5 pull-ups

[The CrossFit Physique: When Performance Builds a Better Body](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-physique)  

CrossFit’s mission is to forge elite fitness, but an undeniable byproduct is its athletes' strong, capable physiques. Unlike traditional bodybuilding, which often prioritizes aesthetics over function, CrossFit’s constantly varied, high-intensity training produces bodies that are powerful, resilient, and beautiful. Rooted in the training philosophies of early strongmen and Olympic weightlifters, CrossFit builds muscle, strength, and endurance through functional movements, lifting heavy, and pushing intensity. When paired with a whole-foods-based diet, this approach delivers the ultimate combination — unmatched fitness and an athletic physique. In short, train like an athlete, and you’ll look like one, too.

400-meter run  
25 Russian kettlebell swings

♀ 53 lb  
♂ 70 lb

Post times to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout contains five sprint-type efforts. The goal is to complete the run as quickly as possible, get your hands on the kettlebell, and go unbroken on your swings. You should have at least 2 minutes of rest between sets, which will allow you to recover and hit each set with intensity. Athletes who are capable of swinging the heavy kettlebell, but not for the total volume of the workout, should consider reducing the reps of the swings in each round and using the heavier bell. Push the pace on the runs, but only as much as allows you to get back to the kettlebell and immediately begin swinging.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of the run. Reduce the loading and/or reps of the kettlebell.

To reduce the complexity of the kettlebell swings, consider reducing the range of motion or performing kettlebell sumo deadlifts.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing 900/1,250 meters on the Echo bike, or 400/500 meters on the rower or ski erg instead of the run. For the kettlebell swings, consider single-arm kettlebell swings or unloaded good mornings.

**Intermediate option:**

21 front squats  
15 bar-facing burpees  
9 strict handstand push-ups

♀ 75 lb  
♂ 115 lb

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a classic triplet. The barbell in this workout is on the light-to-moderate side and should be light enough to challenge you to be unbroken in each set while being heavy enough to tempt you to put it down. Be cautious of the pressing fatigue from the combination of burpees and strict handstand push-ups. Focus on managing your pace and breaking before you need to to avoid hitting failure early in this effort.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the front squats and the reps of handstand push-ups to no less than 5 per round.

To reduce the complexity of the strict handstand push-ups, consider pike push-ups or seated dumbbell shoulder presses.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider using dumbbells for the front squats if there is a rack position limitation. For the burpees, consider up-downs. For the strict handstand push-ups, consider single-dumbbell shoulder presses.

**Intermediate option:**    
4 rounds for time of:  
21 front squats  
15 bar-facing burpees  
**5** strict handstand push-ups

♀ **35-lb barbell** and **15-lb dumbbells**  
♂ **45-lb barbell** and **20-lb dumbbells**

**Coaching cues:**  
As you are pressing out of the handstand, focus on bringing your ribs to your hips and looking across to the other side of the room. These will keep your body more well-connected and avoid excessive arching in the spine.

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a repeat from February. Treat each round like a back-and-forth “sprint.” For most, choose options that allow you to keep each round to 90 seconds or less and consider one of two options: one, use the same options as last time and go faster, or two, perform the workout with a more difficult scaling option. Either way is a PR. If you are working to build capacity in legless rope climbs, today could also be a good day to pace the bike to maximize your potential for the rope climbs.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the calories on the bike and the height of the rope climb.

To reduce the complexity of the legless rope climbs, perform the movement with assistance from your legs or reduce the height of the climb.

In case of an injury or limitation, perform pull-to-stands in place of the rope climbs. For the calories on the bike, consider a 150-meter row or a 150-meter run.

**Intermediate option:**    
**7** rounds for time of:  
7/10-calorie Echo bike  
1 legless rope climb to **12 feet**

**Beginner option:**   
**5** rounds for time of:  
**6/8**-calorie Echo bike  
**2 pull-to-stands**

**Coaching cues:**  
When seated on the bike, focus on driving through the ball of the foot and sitting up tall. A more upright torso will help you breathe more efficiently and create better posture to push and pull from.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a weightlifting and monostructural couplet. The reps are relatively low to keep round cycle time faster for those who are proficient in both movements. Performing a single round in less than 1 minute is certainly possible, but today could also be a good day to work on double-unders, or on the push jerk under some fatigue. The loading on the barbell should feel challenging, but still allow you to perform unbroken reps in each round.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell.

To reduce the complexity of the jump rope, choose one of two options, either performing double-under attempts for 30 seconds or single-unders. For the push jerks, perform push presses.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider riding a bike for 5/7 calories. For the push jerks, consider using dumbbells if there is a rack position limitation.

Today is a heavy day. Keep in mind, heavy is relative to each athlete's capacity and experience. As long as you are working to your limits, you will benefit from today’s effort. Experienced athletes should build to a heavy set of 2 and plan to go as heavy as possible across all sets. Newer athletes should start light, focus on mechanics, and slowly add weight as they are comfortable.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell to maintain safety and the integrity of the lift.

To adjust the complexity of the lift, consider performing a goblet squat with a dumbbell or kettlebell.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider squatting with a single dumbbell or kettlebell. You can also lunge with a load or perform an unloaded air squat.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
Same as Rx’d.

**Coaching cues:**  
As you stand up out of the bottom of the squat, focus on the shoulders and hips rising together while driving through your heels to stand.

[Mastering CrossFit Gymnastics: How to Build Strength, Stability, and Confidence](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-mastering-gymnastics)  

Struggling with gymnastics skills in CrossFit? You're not alone. Many athletes feel overwhelmed by movements like toes-to-bars and handstand push-ups, unsure how to improve. The key to mastering gymnastics is breaking it down — just like weightlifting — by focusing on four foundational elements: shapes, tension, flexibility, and strength. By consistently practicing static holds, mobility drills, and strict strength work, you can build a solid base for kipping and dynamic movements. This guide offers a structured three-week plan to improve your gymnastics skills, helping you do workouts as prescribed with confidence.

"Saturday 250329","For time:  
2,400-meter run  
50 hand-release push-ups  
2,400-meter run

Post times to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is an endurance and stamina effort with a bit of a “speed bump.” Push the pace on the first run, knowing you are going to get to “rest” during the hand-release push-ups. Expect your reps to slow down, but push your threshold on the hand-release push-ups (pun intended). When you get into the second run, give it everything you have left. If you are attempting this workout as prescribed, your goal is to finish in 45 minutes or less, while keeping the push-ups to 6 minutes or less.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of each run, or the volume of hand-release push-ups.

To reduce the complexity of the hand-release push-ups, perform the reps from the knees or with your hands elevated on a 30-inch box (do not release your hands).

In case of an injury or limitation, consider substituting a 5,500/7,500-meter Echo bike or a 2,400/3,000-meter row in place of the run. For the hand-release push-ups, consider dumbbell floor presses or bench presses.

**Intermediate option:**    
For time:  
2,400-meter run  
**35** hand-release push-ups  
2,400-meter run

**Beginner option:**   
For time:  
**1,000**-meter run  
**35** hand-release push-ups **from the knees**  
**1,000**-meter run

**Coaching cues:**  
If you need a break during the hand-release push-ups, lie flat on your chest with your arms extended out to the sides or come to your knees with your chest off the ground. These are both ways to relax your arms, giving them the best opportunity to recover quickly.

"Friday 250328","5 rounds for time of:  
12 chest-to-bar pull-ups  
12 wall-ball shots  
12 box jumps

♀ 14-lb medicine ball to 10 feet and a 20-inch box  
♂ 20-lb medicine ball to 11 feet and a 24-inch box

Post times to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a classic triplet — two gymnastics movements and one weightlifting movement. You will notice the prescribed height for the wall-ball shots is higher than normal. If you do not have the height, use a heavier ball. Athletes should aim to complete this workout in 15 minutes or less. However, if you go a little longer because you are working on chest-to-bar pull-ups or grinding through the higher wall-ball target, today is a good day for that. Use caution when jumping on the box after the wall-ball shots. If necessary, take a few moments before attempting your first rep. As always, we encourage you to step down from the box on every rep.

**Scaling:**
Reduce the weight of the medicine ball to allow you to hit the higher target. Reduce the height of the box.

To reduce the complexity of the chest to bar pull-ups, reduce the range of motion to chin-over-bar pull-ups. You may also consider jumping chest-to-bar pull-ups or ring rows. For the wall-ball shots, reduce the height of the target and the load of the ball. For the box jumps, reduce the height of the box. Aim to maintain the jump stimulus unless there is an injury or limitation.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing ring rows in place of the chest-to-bar pull-ups. For the wall-ball shots, perform medicine-ball squats for an overhead limitation or wall-ball push presses for a squatting limitation. For the box jumps, perform a box step-up to a lower box.

**Intermediate option:**    
5 rounds for time of:   
12 **chin-over-bar** pull-ups  
12 wall-ball shots  
12 box jumps

♀ **10**-lb medicine ball to 10 feet and a 20-inch box  
♂ **14**-lb medicine ball to 11 feet and a 24-inch box

**Beginner option:**

12 box **step-ups**

♀ **6**-lb medicine ball to **9** feet and a **12**-inch box  
♂ **10**-lb medicine ball to **10** feet and a **20**-inch box

**Coaching cues:**   
On the wall-ball shots, avoid holding your arms up and out as you wait for the ball to return. Instead, hold hands right below your chin with your elbows tight against your sides. As the ball returns, you can then meet the ball with your hands and descend into the next rep.

[Strong Women are the Standard](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-strong-women-are-the-standard)  

The 2021 NCAA basketball tournament highlighted a long-standing misconception about women and strength training, but CrossFit has always challenged this narrative. In CrossFit, women lift heavy, develop real-world strength, and reap the benefits of resistance training — including improved metabolism, bone density, mobility, and overall health. Strength is essential for true fitness, and any program that neglects it is incomplete. Strong women aren’t the exception — they’re the standard.

"Wednesday 250326","3 rounds for time of:  
200-meter dumbbell farmers carry  
40 GHD hip extensions  
40-calorie row

♀ 35-lb dumbbells  
♂ 50-lb dumbbells

Post times to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a bit of a grind — put your head down and move. Your goal is to complete this workout in 30 minutes or less. Use dumbbells that allow you to complete the farmers carry in 2 sets or less. In the first 2 rounds on the rower, pace yourself so you can pick up the dumbbells and get moving. However, in the final round, unload every ounce of energy left on the last row. Get after it!

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the dumbbells. Reduce the reps on the GHD hip extensions and calories on the rower.

To reduce the complexity of the dumbbell farmers carries, consider using a single dumbbell. On the GHD hip extensions, reduce the range of motion or perform good mornings unweighted or with an empty barbell.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing unweighted good mornings in place of the GHD hip extensions. For the calories on the rower, substitute any machine available.

**Intermediate option:**    
3 rounds for time of:  
200-meter dumbbell farmers carry  
**30** GHD hip extensions  
**30**-calorie row

♀ **20**-lb dumbbells

**100**-meter dumbbell farmers carry  
**20 unweighted good mornings**  
**20**-calorie row

♀ **10**-lb dumbbells  
♂ **15**-lb dumbbells

**Coaching cues:**  
In the set-up of the GHD hip extension, make sure the hips are free of the pad and able to move. As you flex at the hips, pull your chest up, away from the ground. The parallels between this movement and a deadlift should be evident.

Hang squat cleans  

Perform a 50-foot handstand walk after each set.

♀ 75-lb barbell  
♂ 115-lb barbell

Post times to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
In today’s workout, push to maintain unbroken hang squat cleans. The loading should feel light to moderate and allow you to hang on to the larger sets. The handstand walk should be a nice “break” before getting back on the barbell. However, don’t be fooled — getting upside down after the hang squat cleans will be more difficult than you think. Advanced athletes should challenge themselves to perform the handstand walks unbroken, and if you fail to make it 50 feet, go back to the start. Have fun!

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the distance of the handstand walk.

To reduce the complexity of the hang squat clean, consider a power clean plus front squat, or using a single or pair of dumbbells. For the handstand walks, consider putting your feet on a box and walking in a complete circle (do this once per 50 feet). You may also consider 20-30 shoulder taps or bear crawls.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider hang power cleans or light goblet squats in place of the hang squat cleans. For the handstand walks, consider shoulder taps in the plank position or a 30-second sprint on the ski erg.

6 left-arm kettlebell snatches  
9 GHD sit-ups

♀ 35-lb kettlebell  
♂ 53-lb kettlebell

Post rounds and reps to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a gymnastics and weightlifting triplet. The reps are low, which will allow you to accumulate a good amount of rounds. Athletes should aim to complete at least 5 rounds. Expect the volume accumulation of GHD sit-ups into the kip swing and hip extension in the kettlebell snatches to be challenging. If you have not been training consistently with the GHD sit-up, consider scaling options and alternatives.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the kettlebell.

To reduce the complexity of the muscle-ups, consider performing fewer reps per round — 1 or 2. You may also consider jumping muscle-ups or low-ring transitions. For the kettlebell snatches, consider single-arm kettlebell swings to eye level or hang dumbbell snatches. For the GHD sit-ups, reduce the range of motion or perform V-ups or AbMat sit-ups.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider ring rows or low-ring muscle-up transitions in place of the muscle-ups. For the kettlebell snatches and GHD sit-ups, consider the scales mentioned above.

**Intermediate option:**    
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 12 minutes of:  
3 ring muscle-ups

**Coaching cues:**  
On the kettlebell snatch, extend the hips just like you would a kettlebell swing. Then, to keep the bell close to your body, pull back on the kettlebell with the elbow moving high and outside. This action gets the bell moving vertically and closer to the body.

"Saturday 250322","7 sets:  
Accumulate a 30-second L-sit hold  
3 heavy deadlifts

Rest 2 minutes between sets.

Post loads to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is not your typical strength day. We have gymnastics strength and weightlifting strength in the same effort. The goal is to complete the L-sit hold in as few sets as possible, then lift a heavy set of 3 deadlifts. Use an option for your L-sit hold that allows you to complete 30 seconds in 3 sets or less. For the equipment used for the L-sit holds, use anything at your disposal — parallettes, boxes, heavy dumbbells, rings, or even the floor. Aim to stay consistent with your L-sit hold and increase the loading of your deadlift as you are able. Keep in mind that heavy is relative and some days are better than others. Stay within your capacity and listen to your body.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell. Reduce the duration of the L-sit hold to no less than 20 seconds.

To reduce the complexity of the L-sit hold, shorten the levers (legs). Consider bending one leg and keeping the other straight, bending both legs, or simply holding knees above your hips in a tuck position. 

In case of an injury or limitation, consider holding a plank or hollow hold for the L-sit holds. For the deadlifts, consider lifting from blocks, sumo deadlifts, or unloaded good mornings. Remember, we are looking for pain-free range of motion.

**Intermediate option:**    
7 sets:    
Accumulate a **20**-second L-sit hold, **one leg straight**  
3 heavy deadlifts

Rest 2 minutes between sets.

**Beginner option:**   
7 sets:  
Accumulate a **20**-second **tuck hold**  
3 deadlifts

Rest 2 minutes between sets.

**Coaching cues:**  
In the deadlift, use your breath to help control the stability of your midline. Before lifting the barbell off the ground, take a deep breath and hold it. After you move through the sticking point, let that breath out. Inhale again as you descend into the next rep.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a pyramid scheme. Your goal should be to complete this effort in 30 minutes or less. Perform the row as prescribed as long as you can keep each to 5 minutes or less. Use a weight for the dumbbells that allows you to maintain sets of 10 thrusters at a time. For the pull-ups, choose an option that allows you to complete your reps in 2 minutes or less. Get after it today!

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the dumbbells, the distance of the row, and/or the volume of the pull-ups and legless rope climbs.

To reduce the complexity of the pull-ups, consider ring rows or jumping pull-ups. For the legless rope climbs, consider reducing the height of the climb or performing regular rope climbs using your legs.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider substituting the row with a 2,500-meter Echo bike or an 800-meter run. For the thrusters, consider dumbbell front squats if you have an overhead limitation or push presses if you have a squat limitation. If you are unable to hang from the bar, consider ring rows or bent-over rows for the pull-ups and pull-to-stands for the rope climbs.

[The Power of CrossFit for the Aging Athlete: Strength, Longevity, and Community](https://www.crossfit.com/efficacy/crossfit-for-aging-athletes-heidi-moody)  

Aging doesn’t mean slowing down — especially in the CrossFit world. Despite societal misconceptions, aging adults often see the most significant fitness gains, improving strength, mobility, and overall well-being. CrossFit’s emphasis on functional movements, weight-bearing exercises, and high-intensity training helps counteract age-related muscle loss, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular decline. Beyond physical benefits, it fosters mental resilience, social connections, and a strong sense of community — crucial for maintaining motivation and independence. With scalable workouts tailored to individual needs, CrossFit empowers aging adults to stay active, confident, and engaged, proving that fitness is for every age.

♂ 155-lb barbell

Post rounds and reps to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a triplet with a lower volume of reps in each set. Expect to perform at least 6 rounds. Round times may decrease due to upper-body fatigue, and the interfering lockout positions of the hang power snatch and strict handstand push-up. By design, this workout demands upper-body stamina, strength, and endurance. To avoid hitting a wall, be intentional with your rest time between movements and focus on using your legs in the hang power snatches to get the barbell overhead. Work hard and have fun.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell.

To reduce the complexity of the jump rope, work for no more than 30 seconds, accumulating double-under reps. If necessary, perform single-unders or penguin hops. For the strict handstand push-ups, reduce the reps to no less than 3 in each round. You can also perform dumbbell push presses or shoulder presses as an alternative.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider riding a bike for 30 seconds per round in place of the jump rope. If you have an overhead limitation, perform single-arm dumbbell snatches or hang power cleans in place of the hang power snatches. As for the strict handstand push-ups, consider push-ups or plank holds.

50 air squats

Compare to [231222.](http://www.crossfit.com/workout/2023/12/22)  

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Even though it doesn’t have a name, today’s workout is a benchmark. Those of you who have completed it in the past know its potency. As a frame of reference, choose options that allow you to keep the run efforts to 2:15 or less and the air squats to 1:30 or less. Push the pace on the run and try not to stop on the air squats. Move at a steady pace on the air squats, and remember to breathe. Expect lactic acid to build up on the squats, but once you get out on the run, that feeling will subside.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of the run. Reduce the number of air squats in each set.

To reduce the complexity of the air squats, consider squatting to a target and moving through a pain-free range of motion.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider substituting a 900/1,250-meter Echo bike or 400/500-meter row in place of the run. If squatting is not an option, consider lunges or unloaded good mornings.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
4 rounds for time of:  
**200**-meter run  
**20** air squats

**Coaching cues:**  
Resist the urge to “fall” to the bottom of the air squat. Instead, focus on pulling yourself down to the end range of motion by screwing your feet into the ground, pressing your hips back and down, and pulling your chest up away from the ground.

Toes-to-bars  
Burpee box jump-overs

♀ 24-inch box  
♂ 30-inch box

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a classic couplet and rep scheme. The descending reps allow you to keep intensity high and keep pushing through this effort. Choose options that allow you to move more and rest less. Advanced athletes may be able to perform all their sets of toes-to-bars unbroken; however, as long as you can complete each set in 3 sets or less, challenge yourself to go as prescribed and use today as more of a skill day.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the height of the box to maintain the jumping stimulus, even if that means reducing the height to 4 inches. If there is an injury or limitation, utilize the step-up or another alternative.

To reduce the complexity of the toes-to-bars, limit the height of your toes or knees. If you have toes-to-bars but the volume in today’s workout is beyond your capacity, reduce the reps to 15-12-9 or 12-9-6.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing up-downs in place of the burpees and step-ups in place of the box jump-overs. For the toes-to-bars, consider V-ups, sit-ups, or plank holds.

**Intermediate option:**

Post time to the comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is an ascending ladder of rope climbs and a descending ladder of bench presses. Expect this to be more of a moderate-duration effort and a bit of a “pump” session. Since both movements can be more upper-body dominant, focus on your foot hook while climbing the rope and avoid pushing to failure on either movement. This will help take some demand off the upper body and reduce fatigue. If you completed the Open workout yesterday and feel fatigued, reduce the intensity today by slowing down or choosing less-demanding scaling options. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the bench presses. If you are able to perform a rope climb, but the later sets contain too many reps, consider reducing the reps to 1/2/2/2/2/2.

To reduce the complexity of the bench presses, consider performing dumbbell bench presses or floor presses. For the rope climbs, reduce the height of the climb, perform pull-to-stands, or consider pull-ups or ring rows.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing single-arm dumbbell bench presses or floor presses. If necessary, perform push-ups to eliminate the loading. For the rope climbs, consider pull-to-stands, ring rows, or dumbbell bent-over rows.

[CrossFit and the Interference Effect](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-interference-effect)  

Traditional fitness wisdom once dictated that strength and endurance training should be separate to avoid the “interference effect,” where endurance work was believed to hinder strength gains and vice versa. CrossFit challenged this outdated approach by blending strength and conditioning within the same workouts, maximizing both in a way that traditional split routines cannot. While CrossFit incorporates pure endurance and heavy lifting days, its signature mixed-modality met-cons effectively bridge the gap, developing both aerobic and anaerobic capacity. This method yields superior fitness adaptations without excessive interference, preparing athletes for real-world demands where strength and endurance must coexist seamlessly.

Perform a 100-meter front-of-body object carry after each set on the bike.

♀ 80 lb  
♂ 100 lb

Post time to the comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a shorter effort. Aim to sprint the calories on the bike and keep a steady pace on the object carry. For the object carry, use anything you have available. This can be a sandbag, D-ball, one or two kettlebells or dumbbells, or a barbell. Work hard and have fun.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the object and reduce the calories on the bike.

To reduce the complexity of the front-of-body object carry, consider the type of object you hold. Some objects may be held more easily than others.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider substituting the bike with a rower, ski erg, or air runner. For the object carry, consider performing a farmers carry or holding the object on either shoulder as opposed to the front-of-body position.

800-meter run  
40 double-unders  
20 GHD sit-ups  
10 ring dips

Post your fastest and slowest times to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout contains three intervals. The goal is to complete each interval as quickly as possible and within the 7-minute clock so you have rest between sets, which will allow you to hit each interval at a good pace. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of the run. If possible, maintain the volume of each movement, but reduce the complexity of each.

If you are unfamiliar with or have not been training consistently with the GHD, reduce the range of motion or perform weighted sit-ups or AbMat sit-ups. For the double-unders, perform attempts for 1 minute or 40 singles. For the ring dips, lower the rings closer to the ground and use your legs for assistance. If necessary, perform a box or bench dip.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider substituting the run with a 1,750/2,500-meter Echo bike or an 800/1,000-meter row. For the double-unders, perform jumping jacks or low box step-ups for no more than 1 minute. For the sit-ups, perform 30-second to 1-minute plank holds. For the ring dips, consider foot-assisted box or bench dips, or push-ups with your hands on a 30-inch box.

**Intermediate option:**    
On a continuously running clock, every 7 minutes for 3 sets, complete:  
800-meter run

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today is a heavy day. As always, heavy is relative to each athlete's capacity and experience. You will benefit from today's effort if you are working to your limits. Experienced athletes should build to a heavy set of 5 and plan to go as heavy as possible across all sets. Newer athletes should start light, focus on mechanics, and slowly add weight as they are comfortable.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell as needed to maintain consistently sound mechanics.

To adjust the complexity of the lift, consider performing a goblet squat with a dumbbell or kettlebell.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider squatting with a single dumbbell or kettlebell. You can also lunge with load or perform unloaded air squats.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a longer-duration grind. If you completed the Open workout yesterday, consider using this workout as an opportunity to move, get the blood flowing, and have some fun. If this is a normal training day, treat it as such and get after it. Choose a weight for the kettlebell swings that allows you to complete the reps in 2 sets or less.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the kettlebell. To reduce the total volume of the workout, reduce the duration to 10-15 minutes.

To reduce the complexity of the burpees, perform up-downs. For the kettlebell swings, reduce the range of motion to Russian kettlebell swings or kettlebell deadlifts. For the shuttle run, consider a movement substitution.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider using a movement substitution for the shuttle runs. Perform a 500/700-meter Echo bike or a 200/250-meter row.

[Training Through Injury: Smart Strategies to Stay Fit and Recover Faster](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-training-through-injuries)  

If you get injured, your priority should be maintaining as much fitness as possible while allowing your body to heal. Instead of completely resting, adapting your training can help minimize fitness loss and prevent long-term setbacks. Strategies such as varying exercises, adjusting range of motion, and modifying tempo allow you to work around injuries safely. For more significant injuries, training surrounding muscles, focusing on cardiovascular fitness, and using contralateral training can support recovery. By staying active and making smart modifications in CrossFit classes, you can continue progressing your fitness without worsening your injury.

♀ 24-inch box  
♂ 30-inch box

Post times to the comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a pyramid rep scheme with two movements. This is a moderate-duration effort that challenges you to push the pace with an elevated heart rate. The box jump-overs are slightly higher and require a bit more effort and focus as you are moving from one side to the other. Push the pace on each run and keep moving on the box jump-overs.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of the run and volume of the box jump-overs.

To reduce the complexity of the run, consider reducing the distance or substituting with an alternative. For the box jump-overs, reduce the height of the box to a height that allows you to maintain the jump. If necessary, consider stepping up as opposed to jumping.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider substituting the 400-meter run with a 900/1,250-meter Echo bike or a 400/500-meter row. For the 800-meter run, substitute with a 1,750/2,500-meter Echo bike or an 800/1,000-meter row. For the box jump-overs, reduce the height and perform step-ups or lunges.

**Intermediate option:**

**Coaching cues:**  
To speed up the box jump-overs, try turning 180 degrees on top of the box before stepping down. This turn on top of the box will set you up to perform the next box jump-over because you will be facing the box and prepared for the next rep.

8 dumbbell goblet squats  
8 handstand push-ups

♀ 50-lb dumbbell  
♂ 70-lb dumbbell

Post reps to the comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is quick and to the point. With the complementary movement functions and the small amount of reps in each set, you should be able to move through a single round in 90 seconds or less. More advanced athletes may be able to maintain unbroken handstand push-ups and keep rounds under 1 minute. Don’t pace on this one. Keep the gas pedal down and the workout will be over before you know it. Work hard and have fun.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the dumbbell to a weight that allows you to maintain unbroken reps for the entire workout. Reduce the reps of the handstand push-ups if the volume of each round is too much. Consider as few as 4 reps.

To reduce the complexity of the goblet squat, reduce the loading of the dumbbell. If necessary, perform an air squat and focus on moving through the range of motion. For the handstand push-ups, perform pike push-ups or dumbbell shoulder presses.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider air squats or unweighted lunges in place of the goblet squats. Focus on a pain-free range of motion. For the handstand push-ups, consider push-ups or single-arm dumbbell shoulder or push presses.

**Intermediate option:**    
Complete as many reps as possible in 8 minutes of:  
8 dumbbell goblet squats  
**4** handstand push-ups

♀ **35**-lb dumbbell  
♂ **50**-lb dumbbell

**Beginner option:**   
Complete as many reps as possible in 8 minutes of:  
8 **air** squats  
8 **dumbbell push presses**

♀ **10**-lb dumbbells  
♂ **15**-lb dumbbells

**Coaching cues:**  
Squeeze your stomach tight at all times during the handstand push-ups. Not only will this keep your spine in a safe position, but maintaining a rigid torso during the kip maximizes the amount of energy transferred from the kip into the press. Without a rigid midline, a significant amount of energy from your legs can be lost, resulting in a more difficult press.

Every minute on the minute for 5 minutes for load:  
2 touch-and-go power snatches

Every minute on the minute for 5 minutes for load:  
1 power snatch

Post loads to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is an opportunity to lift heavy. Keep in mind, heavy is relative to each individual's capacity and competence with the lift. The goal is to lift your heaviest load for each 5-minute section. You can increase the loading across each minute, maintain the same weight for multiple sets, or stay at one weight for the entire workout. Newer and less-experienced athletes should focus on refining technique at submaximal loads rather than increasing the weight throughout the workout.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell to maintain the integrity of the lift.

To reduce the complexity of the lift, reduce the loading and consider performing a hang power snatch to avoid having to navigate the knees.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing a power clean for an overhead limitation. You can also perform a single-arm snatch with a dumbbell or kettlebell.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
Same as Rx’d.

**Coaching cues:**  
When performing touch-and-go reps, focus on keeping your hips slightly higher as you return the barbell to the floor. This will help keep the knees back and out of the way allowing you to get to the floor without going around the knees.

[Stop Wishing, Start Training: How to Finally Get Your Bar Muscle-Up](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-bar-muscle-up-rx)  

Mastering bar muscle-ups requires dedication, just like learning any other CrossFit movement. Many athletes assume they lack natural gymnastics ability, but success comes from consistent practice, not talent alone. By treating gymnastics skills like weightlifting — focusing on technique, muscle memory, and structured progression— you can build the necessary strength and coordination to work toward your first bar muscle-up.

1 minute of row calories  
1 minute of GHD hip extensions  
1 minute of strict pull-ups

Rest 1 minute between rounds.

Post total reps to the comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout allows you to choose your own adventure. Push the pace in each minute or pull back depending on how you are feeling. If you performed the Open workout yesterday, you may need to take today as an active recovery day. Either way, choose options for the GHD hip extensions and the strict pull-ups that allow you to move for the majority of the minute. Today’s workout is a great opportunity for newer athletes to build capacity and practice the GHD hip extension. That said, reduce the range of motion as needed to focus on maintaining a rigid, unchanging back position.

**Scaling:**  
To reduce the volume of reps accumulated, reduce the total number of rounds in today’s effort.

To reduce the complexity of the GHD hip extension, reduce the range of motion. Athletes who are unfamiliar with the movement can perform a good morning unweighted or with an empty barbell. As for the strict pull-ups, perform banded strict pull-ups or ring rows. If you choose to use a band for strict pull-ups, choose one that allows you to complete consistent sets of 3-5 reps.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider substituting the row with a run, bike, or ski erg. For the GHD hip extension, perform an unloaded good morning. For the strict pull-ups, perform a ring row or a bent-over row with a dumbbell.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
**3** rounds for total reps of:  
1 minute of row calories  
1 minute of **unloaded good mornings**

Rest 1 minute between rounds.

**Coaching cues:**  
In the GHD hip extensions, consider a string linking your belly bottom to your sternum. As you lower your torso, pull the string tight. If your belly button gets closer to your sternum the string becomes loose and your back begins to round.

[Unlock Stronger Barbell Lifts: The Crucial Role of Your Lats in Deadlifts, Cleans, and Snatches](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-stronger-barbell-lifts)


Your lats play a critical yet often overlooked role in barbell movements like the deadlift, clean, and snatch. As the largest upper-body muscle, they help maintain bar path efficiency by keeping the weight close to your center of mass, reducing strain on your lower back, and improving lifting mechanics. Engaging your lats properly during the setup and pull phases prevents bar drift, enhances control, and leads to stronger, more efficient lifts. Try these drills to get your lats working more purposefully.

Post time to comments.

Compare to [220208.](https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2022/02/08)  

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today's workout is simple and effective. If it looks “too easy,” go faster. This is a short-to-moderate duration effort. If you can perform 35 double-unders in 2 minutes or less, do the workout as prescribed. Remember, on Friday we will be performing Open Workout 25.1 as the Workout of the Day. Moderate today’s effort accordingly.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the reps of the double-unders and the distance of the run.

To reduce the complexity of the double-unders, consider performing 2 minutes of double-under attempts or 35 single-unders.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider substituting the run with a 500/700-meter Echo bike, or a 200/250-meter row or ski erg. For the double-unders, consider jumping jacks or a low box step-up.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a back-and-forth couplet. Aim to perform at least 5 rounds, but don’t be surprised if some athletes creep up toward 9. Expect this one to be sneaky on your legs. With the sumo setup and the step-up on the box, the lactic acid build-up and your leg stamina may be the limiting factor. The loading for each movement should allow you to keep moving for the entire duration of the workout. Take small breaks and get back to it.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the barbell and/or the dumbbells.

Reduce the complexity of the sumo deadlift high pull by using a kettlebell or dumbbell to perform the movement. As for the dumbbell box step-overs, reduce the height of the box or perform the movement without any weight.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing the sumo deadlift high pull with a kettlebell or dumbbell. The same movement can also be performed with a single arm. As for the dumbbell box step-overs, perform these with no weight and reduce the height of the box.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a longer effort. Find a pace on the bike you can maintain — avoid coming out hot on the bike and seeing your pace fall off. Sit up tall, breathe, and focus on your cadence. Choose options for the wall-ball shots and the knees-to-elbows that allow you to complete the 60 reps in 5 minutes or less per round. Work hard and have fun!

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance on the bike. Reduce the loading of the medicine ball.

To reduce the complexity of the wall-ball shots, consider reducing the height of the target and the weight of the medicine ball. For the knees-to-elbows, reduce the range of motion. Consider performing knees-to-chests or hanging knee raises.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider substituting the bike with an 800-meter run, or 800/1,000 meters on the rower or ski erg. For the wall-ball shots, perform a medicine-ball front squat, dumbbell push press, or light dumbbell thruster. For the knees-to-elbows, perform V-ups or sit-ups.

[Get Your First Handstand Push-Up](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-handstand-push-up-rx-plan) 

Handstand push-ups (HSPU) can be one of the most frustrating yet exciting skills in CrossFit. In this third installment of her gymnastics series, coach Pamela Gagnon breaks down the essential strength and technique components needed to progress toward an HSPU. She emphasizes the importance of training both the handstand (stability) and the push-up (pressing strength) separately before combining them. Gagnon provides clear strategies to build strength and confidence and avoid some of the most common mistakes.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today is a day to find a heavy single in three classic lifts. This workout has been coined as “The Other Total.” Experienced athletes should shoot to find a heavy single in each movement. Keep in mind, heavy is relative to your capacity and experience. Work hard and stay within yourself. Newer athletes should work on mechanics and building consistency rather than testing maximal loads. For the overhead squat, take the barbell out of a rack if one is available. For the bench press, it is recommended to have a spotter available. If you do not have a spotter, do not risk pushing to failure.

**Scaling:**
Reduce the loading of the barbell if needed to maintain safety and the integrity of each lift.

To adjust the complexity of each lift, we encourage you to reduce the load to something that allows you to practice the technique and maintain safety.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing a hang power clean with a barbell or a pair of dumbbells. For the bench press, consider a dumbbell bench press or a dumbbell floor press. For the overhead squat, consider an overhead lunge with a single dumbbell or barbell. If the overhead position is limiting, consider a front or back squat.

**Intermediate option:**   
Same as Rx’d 

**Beginner option:**   
Clean **3-3-3** reps  
Bench press **3-3-3** reps   
Overhead squat **3-3-3** reps

**Stimulus and Strategy:**   
Today’s workout is a longer-duration chipper and you should expect it to be a grind. Relax your grip on the rower so you’re ready for the farmers carry. For the handstand walk, chip away in manageable chunks of the distance. Work hard and have fun today!

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distances of each movement. Reduce the loading of the dumbbells.

To reduce the complexity of the farmers carry, consider only carrying one dumbbell or doing a low-box dumbbell step-up. To scale the handstand walk, complete 5-7 full circles around a box with your feet on the box (walking laterally around the box). You can also scale the handstand walk to an inchworm or a bear crawl. To reduce the complexity of the lunge, use one dumbbell or no weight.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider substituting the row for an 800-meter run or a 1,750/2,500-meter Echo bike. For the farmers carry, perform 100 low-box step-ups. For the handstand walk, consider an alternating dumbbell shoulder press or shoulder taps in a plank hold. For the lunges, perform these with no load or an air squat to a target.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s effort is a slight variation of a 2008 CrossFit Games workout. This couplet should feel relatively heavy but still fast-paced. Choose a challenging deadlift load, but one you can complete unbroken with sound technique. Choose an option for the burpees you can complete in 1 minute or less per round. The goal is to complete this workout in 10 minutes or less. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading so you can complete each set of deadlifts unbroken. Reduce the number of burpees so you can complete the reps in 1 minute or less.

To reduce the complexity of the deadlifts, reduce the weight. You may also consider a sumo stance with the hands inside the legs.
 
To reduce the complexity of the burpees, perform up-downs or burpees in place.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing dumbbell or kettlebell deadlifts, or unloaded good mornings. For the burpees, perform up-downs or push-ups, using an elevated target as needed.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout provides some contrast to yesterday’s upper-body stamina effort. Today tests your midline and lower-body stamina. Athletes should push to complete at least 3 rounds. Choose options that allow you to complete a single round in 5 minutes or less. Expect your legs to feel heavy in the first 100 meters of each run. Focus on picking up your feet, getting your body moving, and then increasing your pace.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of the run. Reduce the reps of the air squats and GHD sit-ups.

If you are not familiar with or have not been training consistently with the GHD, reduce the complexity of the GHD sit-ups by reducing the range of motion to parallel or performing AbMat sit-ups. For the air squats, consider squatting to an elevated target that maximizes pain-free range of motion.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing plank shoulder taps or hollow rocks for the GHD sit-ups. For the air squats, perform lunges or low box step-ups. Consider 900/1,250 meters on the Echo bike or 400/500 meters on the rower or ski erg instead of the run.

"Monday 250217","2 rounds for time of:  
35 pull-ups  
35 shoulder-to-overheads

♀ 75 lb   
♂ 115 lb

Post times to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a classic push/pull gymnastics couplet. Expect this effort to test your stamina and give you a pretty significant upper-body pump. The goal is to complete this workout in 10 minutes or less. You may see some more advanced athletes finish closer to 5 minutes. Choose a weight that allows you to perform at least 10 reps every time you pick up the barbell. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell to something that feels moderate-to-light. If you are capable of performing pull-ups, but 70 reps is too much volume, reduce the reps to 15-25 in each round.

Reduce the complexity of the pull-up by performing a jumping pull-up, banded pull-up, or ring row. For the shoulder-to-overhead, perform a push press or shoulder press with lighter weight.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider reducing the reps and performing a single-arm ring row or a bent-over dumbbell row in place of the pull-ups. If the rack position is the limitation in the shoulder-to-overhead, use a pair of dumbbells.

**Intermediate option:**    
2 rounds for time of:  
**25** pull-ups  
35 shoulder-to-overheads

♀ **65** lb   
♂ **95** lb

**Beginner option:**   
2 rounds for time of:   
**25 ring rows**   
**25** shoulder-to-overheads

♀ **35** lb   
♂ **45** lb

**Coaching cues:**  
To help with cycling shoulder-to-overhead reps, focus on keeping your elbows up as you return the barbell to the shoulders. This helps maintain the shelf and keeps the barbell from drifting down your chest.

[The CrossFit Warm-Up](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-warmup-flow)  

The CrossFit warm-up provides a more efficient and effective alternative to traditional warm-ups, ensuring you are physically and mentally prepared for your workout. Unlike spending excessive time on stationary cardio or endless mobility drills, CrossFit’s structured approach will increase your heart rate, enhance mobility, reinforce movement patterns, and prevent injury. The classic CrossFit warm-up will prep your body and give you an opportunity to develop skills. With consistent practice, your warm-up routine will build strength, improve your gymnastics capacity, and enhance your overall athletic performance.

"Saturday 250215","5 rounds for time of:  
Row 350/500 meters in as few pulls as possible

After each row, perform 2 double-unders for each pull taken. For example, if it takes 40 pulls to complete the row, complete 80 double-unders before starting the next round.

Post time and number of pulls each round to comments.

Compare to [210928.](https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2021/09/28) 

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout will require thought and strategy. To maximize the distance in each pull, the effort encourages hard pulls on the rower. Increase the damper setting and slow your cadence to minimize the number of pulls each round. If needed, reduce the total distance to something you can complete in 60 total pulls or less in each set.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance on the rower.

To adjust the complexity of the double-under, consider performing single-unders or jumping jacks. If you have double-unders, but they are inconsistent, consider performing attempts and counting both singles and doubles toward your reps.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing jumping jacks, penguin taps, or alternating toe taps on a low box in place of the double-unders.

**Intermediate option:**    
5 rounds for time of:  
Row 350/500 meters in as few pulls as possible.

After each row, perform **1** double-under for each pull taken. For example, if it takes 40 pulls to complete the row, complete 40 double-unders before starting the next round.

**Beginner option:**   
3 rounds for time of:  
Row 350/500 meters in as few pulls as possible.

After each row, perform **1** **single**-under for each pull taken. For example, if it takes 40 pulls to complete the row, complete 40 **single**-unders before starting the next round.

**Coaching cues:**  
To reduce your stroke rate, focus on your return. Release your hands away from your body, lean forward slightly, and count to three as you pull yourself back into the catch position.

♂ 53 lb

Rest with the remaining time in the interval.  
Add 3 reps to the toes-to-bars and kettlebell swings in each progressive 3-minute interval.

Post reps to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a race to complete your reps as quickly as possible to give yourself more rest before starting the next set. With the options you choose for the workout, the first interval should take you no more than 90 seconds to complete. Your goal should be to finish the round of 15 toes-to-bars and 15 kettlebell swings. That said, it is possible for more advanced athletes to get into the set of 21 or higher. If you are unable to complete your reps within the allotted time, your workout is over. During the kettlebell walking lunge, carry the kettlebell however you like.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the kettlebell.

To adjust the complexity of the toes-to-bars, reduce the range of motion. Consider knees-to-chests, hanging knee raises, or hollow rocks. For the kettlebell swings, perform Russian kettlebell swings. For the lunges, perform unweighted or do low box step-ups.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider hollow rocks or sit-ups in place of the toes-to-bars. For the kettlebell swings, perform sumo deadlifts or single-arm Russian kettlebell swings. For the lunges, perform an unweighted lunge or a low unweighted box step-up.

Toes-to-bars are a challenging yet essential CrossFit skill, appearing in 86% of Open workouts since 2011. This movement requires coordination, strength, and spatial awareness. But even if you struggle with toes-to-bars now, you can progress with focused practice, drilling, and scaling as you build to the Rx’d movement and prepare for upcoming events like the Open and Community Cup.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Amanda is a classic benchmark workout. Typically, this workout is performed with a squat snatch, however, today we are going to perform a power snatch.  Most athletes should aim to complete the workout in 12 minutes or less. Some more advanced athletes could finish in 5 minutes or less.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the volume of the muscle-ups. Athletes who have muscle-ups, but not the overall volume, should consider reducing the repetitions to 7-5-3 or 4-3-2.

To adjust the complexity of the muscle-ups, perform a jumping muscle-up, low-ring transition, or ring rows and push-ups. For the power snatch, perform a hang power snatch, a hang muscle snatch, or a dumbbell snatch.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider performing low-ring transitions, or ring rows and push-ups. For the power snatch, consider a hang power clean or single-arm dumbbell snatch.

Compare to [230128.](https://www.crossfit.com/230128)  

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today is a heavy day. Keep in mind, heavy is relative to each athlete's capacity and experience. As long as you are working to your limits, you will benefit from today’s effort. Experienced athletes should build to a heavy set of 5 and plan to go as heavy as possible across all sets. Newer athletes should start light, focus on mechanics, and slowly add weight as they are comfortable.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell to maintain safety and the integrity of the lift.

To adjust the complexity of the lift, consider performing a goblet squat with a dumbbell or kettlebell.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider squatting with a single dumbbell or kettlebell. You can also lunge with a load or perform an unloaded air squat.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
Same as Rx’d.

**Coaching cues:**  
Throughout the squat, imagine your feet are screws and you are trying to screw them into the ground. In doing so, you will create better contact with the ground and keep your knees tracking over your toes.

Stephens is survived by his wife Tiffany; children, Austin, Morgan, and Rylee Ann; parents, Michael and Joann; brother Ken; and several family members.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s Hero workout is a longer-duration effort. This is meant to be a grind, so expect this workout to take up to 60 minutes. Each run and the burpees should take no more than 20 minutes to complete (each). Athletes who are capable of completing this workout in 35 minutes or less can consider adding a weight vest or body armor. Most athletes should attempt this workout using their own body weight. Work hard and have fun.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of the run and the repetitions of the burpees.

To adjust the complexity of the run, instead of reducing the distance, consider using a movement substitution like a bike or a rower. Perform 5,500 meters on an Echo bike or 2,500 meters on a rower or ski erg. For the burpees, reduce the range of motion by performing an up-down.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider the running substitutions mentioned above. For burpees, perform up-downs, push-ups, or mountain climbers.

[Why Am I So Sore?](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-why-sore)  

Muscle soreness, or delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), is a natural part of CrossFit training, resulting from eccentric muscle actions that cause micro-damage, followed by repair and adaptation. While initially frequent for beginners, soreness becomes less common over time but can still occur after high-rep, calisthenic-heavy workouts like Karen or Cindy. Soreness signals productive muscle breakdown and growth, helping athletes build strength and refine technique.

♂ 225-lb deadlifts, 135-lb cleans, 95-lb thrusters

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a chipper and may look familiar. This mash-up fuses together three classic CrossFit benchmarks: Diane, Elizabeth, and Fran, but with fewer reps than the traditional 45 of each movement. That said, this should challenge you to keep moving and maintain larger chunks of reps. All athletes should use options that allow them to finish in 15 minutes or less. Advanced athletes may be able to go sub-10.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of each barbell to something that feels moderate-to-light for each movement and that you can complete in sets of at least 10 while fresh.

To reduce the complexity of the handstand push-up, perform a pike push-up or dumbbell shoulder press. For the ring dips, lower the rings to a position that allows your feet to touch the ground. 
Then use them to help you move through the range of motion. For the pull-ups, perform a jumping pull-up or ring row. For the barbell movements, reduce the loading to something that allows you to focus on the technique and move safely.

In case of an injury or limitation, consider using a single dumbbell for most of the movements. Perform a single-arm shoulder press for the handstand push-ups, a dumbbell sumo deadlift for the deadlift or an unweighted good morning, a push-up or dumbbell floor press for the ring dips, a single-arm dumbbell power clean for the power cleans, a single-arm ring row for the pull-ups, and a single-arm dumbbell thruster, dumbbell front squat, or dumbbell push press for the thruster.

**Intermediate option:**

**Stimulus and Strategy:**   
Today’s workout is a challenge. The goal is to finish the wall-ball shots and run as quickly as possible, and then complete as many burpee box jump-overs as possible in the remaining time. Both the wall-ball shots and the run should take no more than 5 minutes each to complete. This will leave you with at least 2 minutes to complete burpee box jump-overs. Push the pace from the beginning and hold on for the ride.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the wall-ball shots to maintain at least 15 reps per minute. If needed, reduce the reps as well as the load. Reduce the distance of the run to hit the intended time domain.

To reduce the complexity of the wall-ball shot, consider reducing the height of the target or simply performing a thruster with the medicine ball. For the burpee box jump-overs, reduce the height of the box or perform box step-overs.

In case of an injury or limitation, perform a medicine-ball front squat or push press. For the 800-meter run, consider biking 1,750/2,500 meters on an Echo bike or rowing 800/1,000 meters. On the burpee box jump-overs, perform up-downs in place of the burpee and step-ups to a low target for box jumps.

[Let’s Talk About Kipping Pull-Ups](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-kipping-pullups-talk)  

Struggling with kipping pull-ups often stems from a lack of strict pulling strength or proper technique, leading athletes to rely on ring rows or risk injury. Kipping pull-ups require both controlled kip-swing mechanics and solid strict strength as a foundation. Unlike ring rows or banded pull-ups, which don’t translate directly to pull-up progress, focusing on breaking the movement into its components builds the strength, confidence, and safety needed for success.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a back-and-forth “sprint.” While the workout, in its entirety, should be completed in 15 minutes or less, each round should be a sprint. Choose options that allow you to keep each round to 90 seconds or less.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the calories on the bike and the height of the rope climb.

To reduce the complexity of the legless rope climb, perform the movement with assistance from your legs or reduce the height of the climb.    

In case of an injury or limitation, perform pull-to-stands in place of the rope climb. For the calories on the bike, consider a 150-meter row or a 150-meter run.

**Stimulus and Strategy**   
Today’s workout is a unique effort. It’s hard to measure or quantify the work being accomplished when we perform a static hold, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t challenging or productive. As you will see, static holds challenge the stamina of our muscles and our drive to mentally overcome negative thoughts. Most athletes can maintain the structure of this workout. Choose static hold modifications that allow you to hold for 20-30 seconds at a time. Rest as needed between movements and sets.

**Scaling:**  
To reduce the complexity of the handstand hold, consider holding a pike position with your feet on a box or the floor. For the L-sit hold, bending your knees will make the movement easier. For the chin-over-bar hold, consider using a band or putting your feet on a box.

In case of injury or limitation, hold a single dumbbell overhead in place of the handstand hold. For the L-sit hold, perform a seated leg lift with one or both legs. For the chin-over-bar hold, use a pair of rings like you would to perform ring rows; pull the rings to your chest and hold at your chest.

**Intermediate option:**    
Complete as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes of:  
30-second pike hold with **feet on a box**  
30-second squat hold  
30-second L-sit hold with **knees bent**  
30-second chin-over-bar hold  

**Beginner option:**   
Complete as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes of:  
30-second **plank hold**  
30-second squat hold  
30-second **hollow body hold**  
30-second **dead hang hold**

**Coaching cues:**  
In the squat hold, challenge yourself to hold an active position. This means finding a bottom position where your back is neutral, knees are in line with your toes, weight is balanced in your feet, and your hip crease is below your knees.

"Monday 250203","7 sets for load of:  
1 snatch-grip deadlift  
1 snatch pull  
1 snatch  
1 overhead squat

Post loads to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a heavy day with a snatch complex. The goal is to build across each set, working up as heavy as possible. Keep in mind that heavy is relative to each person's capacity and technique. Do not increase the loading if safety or technique are in jeopardy. As you complete each set, a regrip is allowed between the deadlift and snatch pull, and after the snatch pull. However, do not spend more than 10 seconds between movements. The snatch can be performed as a power or squat variation.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell to maintain the integrity of each movement.

To reduce the complexity of the movement, reduce the load to an empty barbell or PVC pipe. For the snatch, perform a hang power snatch.

In case of an injury or limitation, perform this complex with a clean variation (clean-grip deadlift, clean pull, clean, and front squat). This complex can also be performed with a single dumbbell. For the overhead squat, consider an overhead lunge if overhead mobility is limited.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
Same as Rx’d.  

**Coaching cues:**  
Use the hips and legs to drive the barbell up, then press under the bar to receive it as high as possible. As the load increases, expect to receive the bar in a lower squat.

[The Science of Squatting: Unlocking Strength, Safety, and Performance in CrossFit](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/science-of-squatting)  

The squat, a fundamental movement in CrossFit, is vital for athletic performance, health, and longevity. Its benefits range from preserving muscle mass and motor control to enhancing core stability and reducing injury risk. Proper technique, rooted in biomechanics, ensures efficient and safe execution by accounting for individual differences in body proportions, mobility, and anatomical structure. Tailored coaching, scaling, and continuous feedback enable athletes to refine their squats for optimal results, supporting the core CrossFit goal of maximizing work output while maintaining joint health and safety.

♀ 95 lb   
♂ 135 lb

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout takes three movements and gives you an increasing amount of time to accumulate reps. If you are proficient in each movement, keep moving for as much of the interval as possible. Limit yourself to small breaks and push your thresholds in each movement. Less-experienced athletes should not push to failure or exhaustion because you will end up spending more time recovering. Instead, perform a few reps, take small breaks, and then continue to chip away. Expect the longer intervals to require more strategy in comparison to the single minute of work. Going all out for 2 or 3 minutes may not set you up for success in the following movement.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell.

To reduce the complexity of the double-under, perform single-unders, double-under attempts, or a mix of both. For the single-leg squats, consider squatting to a target or performing a reverse lunge. For the hang clean and jerks, use one or two dumbbells.

In case of injury or limitation, perform calories on any machine in place of the double-unders. For the single-leg squats, consider performing a lunge or an air squat. For the hang clean and jerks, consider a muscle clean and shoulder press with a barbell or dumbbells. If you have an overhead limitation, you can also forgo the jerk and just perform the clean.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout focuses on moving a heavier barbell with an elevated heart rate. The goal is to complete this workout in 15 minutes or less. Choose a weight for the barbell that allows you to complete consistent sets of 5 unbroken reps. For the burpee pull-ups, the set of 15 should take no more than 90 seconds to complete.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell or the reps of either movement.

To reduce the complexity of the deadlift, perform a sumo deadlift with a barbell or kettlebell. For the burpee pull-ups, perform an up-down instead of the burpee and lower the pull-up bar to allow you to use your legs more.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a light or unloaded good morning in place of the deadlift. For the burpee pull-ups, perform an up-down in place of the burpees and a ring row for the pull-ups.

[CrossFit for Health and Fitness vs. CrossFit for Points](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-health-vs-competition)  

Observing CrossFit Games athletes can be an inspiring and educational experience, offering insights into their techniques, pacing, and strategies. However, it’s essential to recognize the difference between competitive tactics and training for long-term fitness and health. Games athletes prioritize speed and efficiency, often sacrificing range of motion, tempo, or even safety to gain an edge. For general fitness, focusing on controlled rep tempo, full range of motion, sound technique, proper refueling with whole foods, and listening to the body to avoid injury is paramount. By understanding the context behind competitive practices, we can adopt the elements that align with our goals while leaving the extreme measures for competition.

♀ 35-lb dumbbell and a 20-inch box  
♂ 50-lb dumbbell and a 24-inch box

Post time to comments.

Compare to [190308.](https://www.crossfit.com/190308)  

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
The 2025 Open is right around the corner and today’s workout is a retest of a previous Open workout. If you have completed this workout before, check your score. There is no time cap on today’s effort, however, the goal is to finish in 15 minutes or less.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the dumbbell and the height of the box. Reduce volume of handstand push-ups to something you can complete in 10 sets or less. Athletes can also reduce the distance of both the lunges and the handstand walk.

To reduce the complexity of the lunge and the step-ups, consider performing both or either without a dumbbell. If you cannot perform a strict handstand push-up, use an elevated stable riser as a target, or perform a pike push-up, dumbbell shoulder press, or a push-up. For the handstand walk, consider putting your feet on a box and walking two to three times around the box on your hands or substituting with a bear crawl. You can also perform inchworms as another option.

In case of injury or limitation, perform the lunge with the dumbbell in the front rack position or without a dumbbell. Same for the box step-ups — perform these without a dumbbell or to a lower box. For the strict handstand push-up, consider a single-arm shoulder press or push-up from the knees. For the handstand walk, you could perform a bear crawl. If necessary, performing 20 to 30 calories on any machine is also an option.

**Intermediate option:**    
For time:

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is running intervals. If you have performed this workout in the past, look back at your scores and use them to help you today. Each interval should be treated as a near-maximal effort and should take no more than 2 minutes to complete. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance to achieve the intended time domain.

To reduce the complexity or in the case of a limitation, consider substituting with any machine available. Perform 900/1,250 meters on an Echo bike or 400/500 meters on a rower or ski erg.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.  

**Beginner option:**

**Coaching cues:**  
Move your feet fast, but don't forget about your arms. At any point where you reach near-max speeds, keep your shoulders square and pump your arms with your elbows held at a 90-degree angle. Applying a conscious effort toward your upper-body movement this way can bolster speed by utilizing your entire body more efficiently, and not just your lower half.

There is no hiding in today’s workout — it’s just you, a kettlebell, and your will to hang on. The loading of the kettlebell should allow you to perform the total reps in 5 sets or less. Aim to complete this workout in 10 minutes or less. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the kettlebell as needed. Less-experienced athletes should reduce the total reps.
Reduce the complexity of the movement by performing a Russian kettlebell swing or a kettlebell deadlift.
In case of injury or limitation, perform a single-arm Russian kettlebell swing. If loading is an issue, a box jump is a nice way to stay explosive, but eliminate the weight. If you choose box jumps, perform no more than 100 reps, and step down from each jump.

[Mastering Efficiency: The Core-to-Extremity Movement Theme](https://www.crossfit.com/pro-coach/mastering-efficiency-core-to-extremity)  


At CrossFit’s Level 1 and Level 2 Certificate Courses, athletes learn the foundational movement theme of “core-to-extremity,” a principle that underpins safe, efficient, and powerful movement patterns. Core-to-extremity describes the ideal sequence of force generation, starting with the midline and progressing outward to the extremities, enabling you to stabilize your spine, maximize force, and prevent injury. Movements like the clean, push press, and rowing stroke demonstrate this concept, but poor mechanics — such as early pulling or pressing — can compromise performance and safety. By focusing on proper execution and identifying common faults, you can refine your mechanics, improve efficiency, and achieve better results.

"Saturday 250125","3 rounds for time of:  
15 chest-to-bar pull-ups  
30-calorie row  
45 air squats 

Post time to comments.  

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a triplet with some slight movement interference with the pulling on the pull-ups and rower, then the leg drive on the rower and out of the bottom of the squat. All athletes should aim to complete this workout in 15 minutes or less, although we could see some advanced athletes complete this effort in around 9 minutes. Work hard and have fun!

**Scaling:**  
If you have chest-to-bar pull-ups, but not the volume, reduce the reps to 8-10. On the rower, reduce the calories to a number that takes you no more than 2 minutes to accumulate.

To reduce the complexity of the chest-to-bar pull-ups, consider a chin-over-bar pull-up, a jumping pull-up, or a ring row.

In case of injury or limitation, perform the calories on any machine available. For the chest-to-bar pull-ups, consider a single-arm ring row or bent-over dumbbell row. For the air squats, consider squatting to an elevated target or performing lunges or box step-ups.

**Intermediate option:**    
3 rounds for time of:  
15 **pull-ups**  
**20**-calorie row  
45 air squats   

**Beginner option:**   
3 rounds for time of:  
**10 jumping** pull-ups  
**15**-calorie row  
**20** air squats 

**Coaching cues:**  
When you are in the drive phase on the rower, focus on keeping your shoulders over your hips and your arms long. Just like the deadlift, your hips and shoulders should move together in this phase, not separately.

"Friday 250124","21-18-15-12-9-6-3 reps for time of:   
Alternating dumbbell snatches  
Ring dips  
L-sit hold on the rings (perform seconds instead of reps)

♀ 35-lb dumbbell  
♂ 50-lb dumbbell

Post time to comments.  

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a saucy little number. Push to complete this effort in 15 minutes or less. The loading of the dumbbell should allow you to complete all sets unbroken. For the ring dips, choose a scaling option that allows you to maintain consistent sets of 5 reps or more without excessive rest between sets. The L-sit hold option you choose should allow you to complete each effort in 2 sets or less.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the dumbbell to maintain unbroken reps. If you can perform the prescribed movements, but the volume is too much, consider reducing the reps and seconds to 14-12-10-8-6-4-2.

To reduce the complexity of the dumbbell snatch, perform the movement from the hang position. On the ring dips, lower the rings so your feet can touch the floor and add assistance where you need it throughout the range of motion. You can perform a jumping ring dip or a foot-assisted strict ring dip. For the L-sit holds, consider bending one or both legs. You can even come off the rings and perform your holds in a more stable position like on a pair of boxes or dumbbells. If you are unable to perform a variation of the L-sit hold, substitute seated leg raises.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a dumbbell clean or a single-arm kettlebell swing in place of the snatch. For the ring dips, consider a push-up or single-arm dumbbell floor press or bench press. For the L-sit hold, consider sit-ups or a plank hold.

**Intermediate option:**    
**14-12-10-8-6-4-2** reps for time of:

**Seated leg raises**  

♀ **10**-lb dumbbell  
♂ **15**-lb dumbbell 
 
**Coaching cues:**  
On the rings, lift your chest to help maintain your L-sit hold. If your chest and gaze drop, your hips will shift back slightly, making it more difficult to keep your legs parallel with the ground. Conversely, a tall posture keeps your hips forward, reducing the effort required to lift your legs.

CrossFit prioritizes effective and functional core training as part of its commitment to forging elite fitness. Unlike programs that focus on flashy, high-repetition ab exercises, CrossFit emphasizes midline stabilization — the ability to maintain a neutral spine and resist unwanted trunk movements  —through compound, isometric, and functional movements. Core strength is developed primarily through foundational movements, Olympic lifts, and single-limb exercises that challenge the spine's ability to stabilize under load. Additional complementary exercises isolate and strengthen specific core muscles, ensuring a comprehensive approach to injury prevention and performance enhancement. By prioritizing core stability over superficial ""core work,"" CrossFit prepares athletes for the demands of sport, combat, and life.

"Wednesday 250122","Complete as many reps as possible in 18 minutes of:  
400-meter run  
30 GHD sit-ups  
20 box jumps  
10 power cleans

♀ 20-inch box and 145-lb barbell  
♂ 24-inch box and 205-lb barbell

Post rounds and reps to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is heavier and a longer duration. The goal is to perform 3 or more rounds. The loading of the barbell should be moderately heavy and allow you to perform singles for most of the workout. Expect the GHD sit-ups and box jumps to fatigue your quads, hip flexors, and explosive movement. Because of this, your cleans may feel heavier than expected. Focus on being as tall as possible and getting the shoulders behind the barbell at the top of the lift before pulling into the receiving position. For the GHD sit-ups, if you are not familiar with this movement and consistently training on the GHD, reduce the reps and range of motion.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of each run. Reduce the reps on the box jumps and GHD sit-ups. Reduce the loading of the barbell.

To reduce the complexity of the box jump, lower the height to maintain the jump or perform a step-up. For the GHD sit-up, reduce the range of motion or perform a V-up or a sit-up. For the power cleans, consider performing the reps from the hang position or with a pair of dumbbells.

In case of injury or limitation, for the 400-meter run, perform a 900/1,250-meter Echo bike or 400/500-meter row. For the box jumps, perform step-ups or lunges. For the GHD sit-ups, perform sit-ups or plank shoulder taps.

**Intermediate option:**

400-meter run  
30 GHD sit-ups **to parallel**  
20 box jumps

♂ **20**-inch box and **45**-lb barbell

**Coaching cues:**  
During the power clean, stay patient on your second pull. Once the barbell passes your knees, continue to keep your shoulders over your bar and wait until the barbell gets close to your hips before you extend the hips and begin the third pull.

Calories on the Echo bike

Post calories to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
There is nothing fancy about today’s workout — it’s just you and the “friendly” bike. A good benchmark is to try to accumulate your body weight in calories. That said, this is a “pain cave” kind of effort. How deep are you willing to go? Experienced athletes should try to maintain an uncomfortable pace for as long as possible. Less-experienced athletes should work at a pace that allows them to stay consistent, breathe, and maintain good posture.

**Scaling:**  
This workout is self-scalable. Slow down, breathe, and find a pace that allows you to recover. Speed up when you can speed up and slow down when you need to slow down.
In case of injury or limitation, perform this workout on any machine available.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.  

**Beginner option:**   
Same as Rx’d.

**Coaching cues:**  
Maintaining good posture on the bike can go a long way in mid-workout recovery. Focus on sitting up taller, opening up your airways, and allowing your lungs to get more air.

Compare to [240227.](https://www.crossfit.com/240227?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod) 

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a classic heavy day. The goal is to find a heavy single shoulder press, triple push press, and set of 5 push jerks. Keep in mind that heavy is relative to each person. Even though most athletes can perform this workout as prescribed, the challenge lies in the technical complexities of the movements. Adding load should be based on your ability to stay mechanically sound. Each athlete, regardless of experience level, should focus on technique before adding weight.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load on the barbell to maintain the safety and integrity of each lift. 
 
Reduce the complexity of each movement by reducing the load. Using dumbbells can also decrease the complexity as you do not have to worry about getting the chin out of the way.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a single-arm dumbbell shoulder press, push press, and push jerk.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
Same as Rx’d.

**Coaching cues:**  
Just because the shoulder press is a strict upper-body movement, it doesn’t mean it has to be slow. Move the barbell to the overhead position by keeping your body tight, taking in a big breath, getting your head out of the way, and driving your hands to the sky as quickly as possible.

Diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2018, Scott Hanley refused to accept a grim prognosis. In 2020, he began working out, discovering that fitness and strength training eased his symptoms. Joining CrossFit Belfast in 2021, Hanley embraced high-intensity workouts and skill-building, remarkably reducing his symptoms. Inspired by his transformation, others, like Ian Haldane, followed his lead, finding relief and improved quality of life through CrossFit. Backed by science linking intense exercise to neuroprotection and neuroplasticity, Hanley’s story highlights the power of fitness, community, and determination in living well with Parkinson’s while inspiring others to keep fighting.

1,000-meter row  
50 deadlifts  
30 handstand push-ups

♀ 95 lb  
♂ 135 lb

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is inspired by the classic CrossFit workout Jackie. Your goal is to finish in 10 minutes or less. Just like Jackie, you need to push the pace on the rower. The workout isn’t won here, but it can certainly be lost. The load of the barbell should feel light and allow you to knock out larger chunks of reps. On the handstand push-ups — just like the pull-ups in Jackie — use whatever you have left in the tank to get across the finish line.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell to maintain sets of 15 reps or more.

To reduce the complexity of the deadlift, consider performing a sumo deadlift or a dumbbell deadlift. For the handstand push-ups, consider a pike push-up, a dumbbell push press, or a standard push-up.

In case of injury or limitation, complete 2,500 meters on the Echo bike or 1,000 meters on a ski erg. For the deadlifts, consider a sumo deadlift with a kettlebell, an unloaded good morning, or a GHD hip extension. For the handstand push-ups, consider a dumbbell shoulder press with one or both arms or a push-up.

Post time to comments.

Compare to [170807.](https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2017/08/07#/comments)  

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a retest of a previous Open workout from 2017. If you have completed this before, look back at your score. In most cases, the barbell loading should not be the limiting factor. Instead, it should be performing these two movements while managing a high heart rate. Most should aim to complete this workout in less than 20 minutes. That being said, today could be a day to try the prescribed version even if you have to break up each set of thrusters. This builds confidence and allows you to establish a time for this benchmark.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell to maintain unbroken reps for most of your sets.

To reduce the complexity of the thruster, use a pair of dumbbells or perform a front squat followed by a push press. For the double-unders, perform as many as you can in 30 seconds or perform single-unders.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a single-arm dumbbell thruster, a front squat for an overhead limitation, or a push press for a squat limitation. For the jump rope, get on any machine and accumulate 6/8 calories per round.

**Intermediate option:**

[Keep the Muscle, Lose the Fat](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/keep-muscle-lose-fat?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  

Chris Masterjohn’s “How to Lose Fat Without Losing Muscle” emphasizes the importance of prioritizing fat loss while preserving lean mass during weight loss. He advises against excessive calorie restriction, recommending instead a focus on full-body resistance training, high-intensity intervals, and adequate protein intake to support muscle retention and overall health. Slow, consistent weight loss—up to 2 pounds per week—is optimal, with exercise playing a critical role in minimizing lean mass loss. Masterjohn’s findings align closely with CrossFit principles, underscoring the effectiveness of functional fitness and whole-food diets in achieving sustainable, healthy results.

For the push-up, place hands on the handle of each dumbbell.

♀ 20-inch box and 20-lb dumbbells  
♂ 24-inch box and 35-lb dumbbells

Post times to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout has grunt work written all over it — it’s one of those where you just need to put your head down and grind. The goal is to complete this workout in 20 minutes or less. Choose an option for the push-up that allows you to perform consistent sets of at least 5-10 reps.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the dumbbells and the height of the box, then reduce the volume per set as needed.

To reduce the complexity of the push-up, perform them with your hands on the floor instead of on the dumbbells. If necessary, perform push-ups for the knees or with your hands elevated on a 30-inch box. For the dumbbell box step-ups, perform them with no weight to a lower target.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a single-arm dumbbell shoulder press in place of the push-up. For the dumbbell box step-up, perform these with no weight to a lower target or consider a lunge.

**Intermediate option:**    
3 rounds for time of:  
30 dumbbell push-ups   
30 dumbbell box step-ups

For the push-up, place hands on the handle of each dumbbell.

**12** dumbbell box step-ups

♀ **12**-inch box and **10**-lb dumbbells    
♂ **20**-inch box and **15**-lb dumbbells  

**Coaching cues:**  
As soon as the speed of your push-up begins to slow, rest. While this may result in a greater number of rest breaks than is strictly necessary, only performing ""fast"" reps and not grinding through a handful of slow ones to finish a set can help avoid reaching failure and yield an overall faster time.

Post load to comments.

Compare to [220821.](https://www.crossfit.com/220821)  

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Most athletes should perform this benchmark workout as written. All athletes should focus on maintaining mechanics and consistency while increasing the loading. Warm up by adding weight slowly, ensuring you can maintain great technique prior to adding additional load. For the set of 15 reps, find a weight you feel confident performing for 10 reps. In the set of 15, reps 1-7 should be no problem, reps 8-12 will take some focus and challenge your barbell stamina, and reps 13-15 should challenge your mental fortitude and barbell technique as you get tired. 

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell to maintain the safety and integrity of the movement.

To reduce the complexity of the movement, reduce the loading and perform a hang clean and push press. Newer athletes should ignore the touch-and-go requirement and instead take a few seconds to establish a sound setup position.

In case of injury or limitation, use a dumbbell or pair of dumbbells. Use a hang power clean instead of a pull from the floor. If there is an overhead limitation, perform the clean only.

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
12-9-6 reps for load of:

Try to hit each of today’s running intervals as quickly as your capacity will allow. Today is a day when most athletes can tackle the effort as prescribed. If you are alone, have a goal in mind for each interval. If you are training with a buddy or a group, keep up with someone who will challenge your pace.

**Scaling:**  
To reduce the volume of this effort, cut the distances in half.

Today is a day when most athletes can perform this as prescribed. However, if you are new or less experienced, complete the beginner option.

In case of injury or limitation, for the 1,600-meter run, perform 3,500/5,000 meters on the Echo bike or 1,600/2,000 meters on the rower. For the 800-meter run, perform 1,750/2,500 meters on the Echo bike or 800/1,000 meters on the rower. For the 400-meter run, perform 900/1,250 meters on the Echo bike or 400/500 meters on the rower. For the 200-meter run, 500/700 meters on the Echo bike, or 200/250 meters on the rower.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout has a rep scheme like you would find in the benchmark [Cindy.](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/workout-demo-for-220927)   However, in this effort, you don’t have the upper-body pressing movement. Instead, we have a triplet that focuses on the midline and lower-body stamina. Choose options that allow you to perform a single round in 2 minutes or less.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the kettlebell to maintain unbroken goblet squats.

Reduce the complexity of the pull-up by performing jumping pull-ups or ring rows. As for the knees-to-elbows, perform knees-to-chest, hanging knee raises, or V-ups. First look to reduce the load of the kettlebell, but if necessary, perform an air squat.

In case of injury or limitation, perform ring rows or a single-arm ring row. For the knees-to-elbows, perform a V-up, sit-up, or plank hold. For the goblet squats, consider an air squat or lunge.

Staff Sgt.Taylor Hoover, 31, of the United States Marine Corps., died Aug. 26, 2021, by a suicide bomber who detonated explosives at Abbey Gate in Kabul, Afghanistan. Hoover joined the Marines in September 2010 and was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton. He was deployed five times in his career and presented with many awards and honors. Hoover is survived by his mother, Kelly Barnett; father, Darin Hoover; sisters Tori Manning and Allison Summers, and their families; and his grandparents, nieces and nephews.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today, we’re doing a Hero workout. Hero workouts are meant to be longer, challenging efforts. This workout is no exception. Expect this to take at least 30 minutes. Choose options that allow you to keep moving at a steady pace. Aim to spend no more than 5 minutes completing a single round.

**Scaling:**   
To adjust the volume, consider reducing the total number of rounds. Reduce the loading of the dumbbell, the height of the box, and the distance of the run.

To reduce the complexity of the burpee box jump-over, consider a burpee box step-over or an up-down step-over. For the dumbbell snatch, consider a hang dumbbell snatch with a lighter load.

In case of injury or limitation, complete 900/1,250 meters on an Echo bike or 400/500 meters on the rower. For the burpee box jump-overs, consider an up-down with a lower step-up. For the bike, use any machine available to accumulate the calories. If there is an overhead limitation, consider performing a kettlebell swing to eye level or a single-arm dumbbell clean.

**Intermediate option:**    
**6** rounds for time of:  
400-meter run  
15 burpee box jump-overs  
10-calorie bike  
6 alternating dumbbell snatches

♀ 20-inch box and **35**-lb dumbbell  
♂ 24-inch box and **50**-lb dumbbell

**Beginner option:**   
**4** rounds for time of:  
**200**-meter run  
10 burpee box **step-overs**  
**7**-calorie bike  
6 alternating dumbbell snatches

♀ **12**-inch box and **10**-lb dumbbell  
♂ **20**-inch box and **15**-lb dumbbell

**Coaching cues:**  
On the dumbbell snatch, focus on keeping the snatching arm long through the middle of the pull next to your body as you accelerate. As you extend the hips, pull the elbow high and outside. Then turn your hand and punch the dumbbell overhead as you pull your body underneath the object.

[Kill Fake Hunger: Simple Strategies to Overcome Cravings and Hit Your Nutrition and Performance Goals](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/kill-fake-hunger?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  

Mastering your nutrition plan starts with understanding that cravings often stem from boredom, habit, or sugar addiction — not true hunger. Build a solid foundation by consuming high-quality foods, balancing macronutrients, and following a consistent eating schedule. Address triggers like dehydration, junk food access, and lack of sleep, and embrace the slight discomfort of hunger as part of the process. If you slip up, don’t dwell — refocus with your next meal. Progress comes from consistency, not perfection, and with patience and these strategies, you can achieve your nutrition and fitness goals.

"Wednesday 250108","For time:  
30 ring muscle-ups

Compare to [230109.](https://www.crossfit.com/230109)  

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a classic benchmark. If you have completed this workout before, check your last time and use that information to help you attack today’s effort. In most cases, this workout should take 10 minutes or less. However, if you have been practicing and accumulating pulling and pressing volume, today can be a good day to work until you complete the reps — don’t worry about the clock. You can build confidence and establish a time for this benchmark.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the total number of reps or perform the intermediate option.

To adjust the complexity of the movement, consider a jumping ring muscle-up, a banded ring muscle-up, pull-ups or chest-to-bar pull-ups + dips, or low-ring transitions.

In case of injury or limitation, perform low-ring transitions or a single-arm dumbbell hang clean and shoulder press.

**Intermediate option:**    
**Complete as many reps as possible in 10 minutes of:**  
Ring muscle-ups  
- Your workout is over if you complete 30 reps before the 10-minute mark.  

**Beginner option:**   
For time:  
30 **low-ring** muscle-up **transitions**

**Coaching cues:**  
To link ring muscle-ups together, at the top of the rep, let the shoulders fall back behind the rings while the arms push the body away from the rings. The feet should be directly below the body, if not slightly in front, as you are pushing away. This technique will send you right into the next swing.

"Tuesday 250107","5 rounds for time of:   
12 push jerks  
12 back squats

♀ 95 lb  
♂ 135 lb

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is just you and the barbell. The loading should feel moderate and allow you to perform at least 2 of the 5 rounds unbroken. A short break between movements is totally fine, but some athletes may be able to finish the last push jerk, lower the bar down to the back rack, and then begin the back squats. If you follow the loading stimulus, the goal is to minimize rest and complete as many sets as possible unbroken. Overall, this workout should take less than 10 minutes. Some advanced athletes may be able to go sub-5. The barbell should come from the floor. Do not use a rack unless there is an injury or limitation.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the load of the barbell to maintain the safety and integrity of each movement, including being able to get the barbell safely from the ground to the back rack.

Reduce the complexity of the push jerk by performing a push press or shoulder press. Consider using dumbbells to reduce the complexity of both movements.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a single-arm dumbbell push jerk or push press and a dumbbell goblet squat. To eliminate the barbell, perform a push-up and an air squat.

**Intermediate option:**    
5 rounds for time of:  
12 push jerks  
12 back squats

♀ **65** lb  
♂ **95** lb

**Beginner option:**   
**3** rounds for time of:  
12 push jerks  
12 back squats

♀ **35** lb  
♂ **45** lb

**Coaching cues:**  
To keep from having to reset the feet on every lift, when you are performing the push jerk, set your feet up in your squat stance. When you jump and land, pick your feet up and put them down in the same spot.

Accumulate 6 minutes of a pull-up bar dead-hang hold 

Each time you drop from the bar, complete 100 double-unders and 30 V-ups.

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a test of your mental fortitude and your ability to drown out the negative thoughts in your mind. The goal is to finish in 20 minutes or less. To help you complete this, you should be able to maintain at least 1-minute hangs from the pull-up bar throughout the entire workout. Choose options that allow you to complete double-unders in 1:30 or less and V-ups in 1:30 or less.

**Scaling:**  
To reduce the total volume of this workout, reduce the amount of time you have to accumulate on the pull-up bar. Newer and less experienced athletes should consider accumulating 3-5 minutes total, especially if they are only able to hang for 20-30 seconds at a time. Reduce the number of double-unders and V-ups to stay within the intended time domains for each movement.

To reduce the complexity of the hang, use a bar that allows you to put one or two feet on the ground for assistance. As for the double-unders, consider trying to accumulate as many reps as possible in 1:30 or performing 100 single-unders. For the V-ups, instead of keeping the legs straight, bend the knees toward the chest and try to touch your heels or perform sit-ups.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a plank hold if you are unable to hang from the pull-up bar. For the jump rope, consider riding a bike for 15-20 calories.

**Intermediate option:**    
For time:   
Accumulate **4** minutes of a pull-up bar dead-hang hold 

Each time you drop from the bar, complete **60** double-unders and **20** V-ups.

**Beginner option:**   
For time:   
Accumulate **3** minutes of a **foot-assisted** pull-up bar hang hold 

Each time you drop from the bar, complete **30 single-unders** and **10 tuck-ups.**

**Coaching cues:**  
Resist gravity as you are hanging from the pull-up bar. This means not letting your shoulders come up to your ears. Instead, use your lats to pull your shoulders away from your ears.

Grip strength is vital for overall performance and injury prevention, especially given the diverse demands of the training methodology. It encompasses three primary categories: crushing (e.g., handshakes), pinching (e.g., holding flat objects), and supporting (e.g., deadlifting), with wrist and forearm strength playing a critical stabilizing role. This 2008 CrossFit Journal article more than holds up and explores the importance of grip strength and provides practical strategies and a sample weekly workout to incorporate into training.

♂ 24-inch box and 70-lb kettlebell

Post total rounds and reps to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today, the goal is to keep moving for the entire workout. Choose movements that allow you to complete each round in 3 minutes or less. The loading of the kettlebell should allow you to complete most of your rounds unbroken. For the ring dips, your option should allow you to perform at least 3 unbroken reps before resting. Stepping down is not required, but is recommended for most athletes.

**Scaling:**  
Reduce the height of the box and the loading of the kettlebell. To limit the volume accumulated, change the time domain to 10 or 15 minutes.

To reduce the complexity of box jumps, consider performing a step-up to a shorter box. For the kettlebell swings, reduce the range of motion by swinging to shoulder height. For the ring dips, lower the rings so you can use your feet for assistance, or modify to ring push-ups.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a kettlebell deadlift or an unloaded good morning. For the ring dips, perform a single-arm dumbbell shoulder press or floor press.

1,600-meter run  
300-foot handstand walk  
24 power snatches

♀ 125 lb  
♂ 185 lb

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a longer-duration chipper. All athletes should aim to complete this effort in 20 minutes or less. The loading of the barbell is meant to be moderately heavy. This means for most, singles will be the most effective way to get through the reps. This load should also allow you to complete at least 4 reps per minute. For the handstand walk, choose an option that allows you to keep moving and advancing. Work hard and have fun with this one.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the distance of the run and handstand walk. Reduce the load of the barbell. If you are new to handstand walking, scale the distance or spend no more than 5 minutes working to accumulate as much distance as possible.

To reduce the complexity of the handstand walk, perform shoulder taps in the pike position or perform a bear crawl. For the power snatches, perform these from the hang position or use a dumbbell.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a 3,500/5,000-meter Echo bike or 1,600/2,000-meter row in place of the run. For the handstand walk, work to accumulate a 2-minute plank hold. For the power snatches, perform a single-arm dumbbell snatch or a clean if there is an overhead limitation.

**Intermediate option:**  
For time:  
1,600-meter run  
**150**-foot handstand walk  
24 power snatches

♀ **95** lb  
♂ **135** lb

For time:  
**800**-meter run  
**150-foot bear crawl**  
24 power snatches

♀ **35** lb  
♂ **45** lb

**Coaching cues:**  
As you walk on your hands, think about pressing your hands down into the floor with each ""step.” Actively pushing down, as if trying to squish the ground underneath your palms, helps keep your arms straight and shoulders stable to keep you on your hands for longer distances.

Front squats  
Chest-to-bar pull-ups

♀ 145 lb  
♂ 205 lb

Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a moderate-to-heavy sprint effort. While this workout does have Fran vibes, expect it to be a bit more challenging. Use a weight and volume for the front squats that allow you to complete the reps in 3 sets or less. For example, completing the set of 21 as 7/7/7. For the chest-to-bar pull-ups, you should be able to complete the reps in a similar manner.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell to complete each round in 3 sets or less. If you prefer to attempt the prescribed load and pull-up variation, reduce the volume to 15-12-9 or 12-9-6 reps.

To decrease the complexity of the front squat, consider using dumbbells held in a front rack or a kettlebell held in a goblet position. For the chest-to-bar pull-ups, reduce the complexity by performing chin-over-bar pull-ups, jumping pull-ups, or ring rows.

In case of injury or limitations, perform your front squats to an elevated target, or substitute with a front-rack lunge, or an air squat. For the chest-to-bar pull-ups, perform single-arm ring rows or a bent-over dumbbell row.

♂ **75** lb

**Coaching cues:**  
On the chest-to-bar pull-ups, consider widening your grip on the pull-up bar. As you are performing reps, extend your upper chest toward the bar to make contact easier. These tips work for both butterfly and kipping pull-ups.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a Tabata mash-up. Complete the full 8 rounds of the first movement before moving on to the next. Continue in the same fashion until all four movements are complete. Your score is the total number of reps completed. The loading of both the dumbbells and the barbell should be light and allow you to keep moving. If you have not been training consistently on the GHD, reduce the range of motion or substitute with AbMat sit-ups.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the total volume of the workout by limiting the number of reps performed within each interval. Reduce the loading of the dumbbells and barbell. Lower the height of the box.

Limit the range of motion on the GHD sit-ups by going to parallel or performing AbMat sit-ups. For the push presses, consider using a pair of lighter dumbbells. As for the bar-facing burpees, perform up-downs or step over the bar.

In case of injury or limitation, perform the box step-ups without a pair of dumbbells and lower the height of the box. Perform a plank hold for the GHD sit-ups. For the push presses, perform a single-arm dumbbell push press or shoulder press. For the bar-facing burpees, perform an up-down or pick any machine to use in place of the exercise.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a benchmark. If you have completed this benchmark previously, look back to your last attempt and use the information to help you attack the row. Push for a PR today. If this is your first time, ease into your first 500 meters and try to increase your pace the further you get into the effort. Most athletes can perform this effort as prescribed and record a benchmark time in the [CrossFit Games app](https://qrcodes.pro/HLEFX0?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod).


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the total distance of the effort.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a 1,600-meter run or 3,500/5,000-meter Echo bike.


**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.


**Beginner option:**   
**On an 8-minute clock:**

Post total rounds to comments.

Compare to [231227](https://www.crossfit.com/231227?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod).

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
The goal today is to perform at least 1 round per minute. Reduce the difficulty of the wall walks to complete each round in 30 seconds or less. Loading of the barbell should feel moderate to heavy, allowing you to maintain unbroken sets for the majority of the workout. 


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell.

To decrease the complexity of the wall walks, reduce the range of motion by only taking two to three steps toward the wall, or performing an inchworm + a push-up.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a sumo deadlift with a barbell, kettlebell, or dumbbell in place of the deadlifts. If needed, eliminate the external loading and perform a GHD hip extension or a PVC good morning. As for the wall walks, perform an inchworm + push-up or shoulder taps in a plank hold.

Compare to [231226](https://www.crossfit.com/231226?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod).


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a short-to-moderate duration effort. The challenge is hanging on when you really want to rest. Aim to complete this effort in 15 minutes or less. Some advanced athletes may be able to go sub 10 minutes. Use a load for both movements that allows you to maintain large sets.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the overall volume by completing 20-30 reps for each movement. Reduce the loading of the dumbbell and medicine ball to maintain sets of 15 or more reps for intermediate athletes and 10 or more reps for beginners.

Reduce the complexity of the dumbbell snatch by performing a hang dumbbell snatch. As for the wall-ball shots, reduce the height of the target.

In case of injury or limitation, perform a single-arm dumbbell snatch on the unaffected arm. If there is an overhead limitation, perform a dumbbell clean or sumo deadlift high pull. For the wall-ball shots, perform a med-ball front squat if there is an overhead limitation or a med-ball push press if there is a squatting limitation.

[How Fit Are You?](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/how-fit-are-you-2?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)

CrossFit’s original fitness competition, predating the CrossFit Games and Open, features five challenging tests designed to assess absolute strength, relative strength, and gymnastics skills. These tests include 1-rep-max lifts, bodyweight movements, and complex gymnastics, with scaling options available. The key goal is not just scoring but identifying weaknesses to improve over time. By working on deficiencies in strength or skill, you can make significant progress, guided by training suggestions included in the article. This approach highlights how focused efforts on weaknesses can lead to remarkable fitness improvements and long-term adaptability.

Post time to comments.

Compare to [231225](https://www.crossfit.com/231225?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod).

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is all bodyweight movements. Scale the difficulty of each element so you can keep moving and perform the reps of each movement unbroken — more moving and less hook-gripping your shorts.


**Scaling:**  
The exercises with the most reps are push-ups through jumping lunges — anywhere from 36 to 42 reps. Reduce the reps as needed or only perform the even rounds (i.e., in Round 1, perform 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. In Round 2, complete 4 knee push-ups, 3 burpees, 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. Continue adding two new exercises each even round).

To reduce the complexity of these bodyweight movements, reduce the range of motion. For example, on the wall walks, only take two steps toward the wall or perform an inchworm. On the burpees, perform an up-down. On the handstand push-ups, perform a dumbbell shoulder press or pike push-up. And for the single-leg squats, use a higher target or do an air squat.

In case of injury or limitation, substitute equipment to preserve the movement function as much as possible, or choose an alternative suitable for your situation.


**Intermediate option:**  
Same as Rx’d.

Perform the workout like the ""12 Days of Christmas"" song. In Round 1, perform 1 inchworm. In Round 2, perform 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. In Round 3, perform 3 burpees, 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. Continue adding a new exercise each round.

**Coaching cues:**  
As you lower yourself to the bottom of an air squat, think about grabbing the floor with your toes and “screwing” your feet into the ground. This will keep your knees tracking your toes and your entire foot in contact with the ground.

Post the number of pull-ups completed for each round to comments.

Compare to [231007](https://www.crossfit.com/231007?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod).


**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
This variation of the classic workout Nicole calls for strict pull-ups. Use the run as recovery for the next set of pull-ups. Athletes should aim to complete around 6 sets within the 20-minute workout.


**Scaling:**  
To limit the total amount of volume, you can “cap” your pull-ups in each round. For example, perform only 3-5 strict pull-ups per round instead of pushing to failure.

If you have strict pull-ups but are unable to perform at least 5 reps, begin each set with a max set of strict pull-ups, and then stay on the bar for a max set of kipping pull-ups. If you do not yet have strict pull-ups, perform a moderately challenging version of banded strict pull-ups or ring rows.

In case of injury or limitation, perform 800/1,000 meters on a bike or 400/500 meters on a rower. For the strict pull-ups, you can perform a single-arm dumbbell bent-over row.


**Intermediate option:**

1 power clean  

Post loads to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a heavy day. Heavy is relative to each athlete. The three movements in the complex are meant to be completed unbroken and in a touch-and-go fashion. Increase the weight across each set as long as technique and safety are maintained. Rest as needed between sets.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the loading of the barbell to maintain the safety and integrity of the lifts.

Use dumbbells to decrease the complexity of the movements.

In case of injury or limitation, perform the complex with a single dumbbell. The movements can also be broken down into bodyweight counterparts: hip extensions for deadlifts, ring rows or pull-ups for the hang power cleans, and a box jump for the power clean.

**Intermediate option:**  
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
7 sets for load of:  
**2** deadlifts  
**2** hang power cleans  
**2** power cleans

[Mental Toughness in CrossFit](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-mental-toughness?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)

Mental toughness is the ability to perform consistently under stress. CrossFit uniquely develops this trait by exposing athletes to challenging workouts that demand both physical and mental resilience. Techniques such as maintaining proper form under fatigue, using positive self-talk, staying present in the moment, and valuing the outcomes of hard work cultivate a mindset of perseverance and confidence. Over time, these strategies not only improve performance in the gym but also equip individuals to handle life’s challenges with greater resolve and adaptability.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**  
Today’s workout is a longer-duration effort. All athletes should aim to complete at least 3 rounds, however, some advanced athletes may be able to knock at the door of 5-6 rounds. Choose an option for toes-to-bar that allows you to maintain consistent sets of 5 or more reps.


**Scaling:**  
Reduce the overall duration of the workout to 15-20 minutes. 

Reduce the distance of the run to something you can complete in 5 minutes or less, the number of toes-to-bars to something you can complete in 4 sets or less, and the number of calories to something you can complete in 2 minutes or less.

Reduce the range of motion of the toes-to-bars by performing knees-to-chests, hanging knee raises, or V-ups.

In case of injury or limitation, perform 800/1,000 meters on the rower in place of the run. Perform sit-ups or a 1-minute plank hold in place of toes-to-bar. Perform a 400-meter run or 400/500-meter row in place of the calories on the bike.

♂ 155-lb barbell and 24-inch box


Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**   
Today’s workout is a short-to-moderate duration effort and is going to take some mental fortitude to push through the front squats. The goal is to choose a weight you can hang on to for all 21 reps. This shouldn’t be easy, but it also shouldn’t be extremely hard. It should be a grind. After the front squats, be careful on your first box jump. Plan to jump a little higher than you think you need to. For the handstand push-ups, choose an option that allows you to complete your reps in 1 minute or less.


**Scaling:**   
Reduce the loading of the barbell and the height of the box.

Maintain the stimulus of the jump unless you have an injury or limitation, in which case you can switch to a step-up. For the handstand push-ups, consider performing dumbbell shoulder presses, or pike push-ups.   

In case of injury or limitation, perform your squats to a target or perform air squats. For the box jumps, reduce the height and perform step-ups or 30 seconds on the bike. For the handstand push-ups, consider a single dumbbell shoulder press or push-ups from the knees.

9 **dumbbell shoulder presses**

Reduce the reps of all three movements to complete each round in 3 minutes or less.
Spend 30 seconds on double-under attempts or perform single-unders. Reduce the height of the rings for the burpee target. Perform jumping ring muscle-ups or low-ring transitions.
In case of injury or limitation, perform 30 seconds of work on any machine for the double-unders. Perform up-downs for the burpees. For the ring muscle-ups, perform a single-arm ring row.


**Intermediate option:**  
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 12 minutes of:

**15** double-unders   
10 burpees-to-rings   
**3** ring muscle-ups

Set the rings to 6 inches above reach.

**Beginner option:**    
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 12 minutes of:   
**15 single-unders**   
**7 burpees**  
**3 low-ring muscle-up transitions**


**Coaching cues:**   
When performing the burpees to a ring, consider putting a mark on the floor under the rings. This mark is where you want to put your hands. Then, when you jump your feet to your hands, your feet will be directly under the rings.

Post time to comments.


**Stimulus and Strategy:**
Today’s workout is a gymnastics and weightlifting couplet. Athletes should aim to complete this workout in 14 minutes or less. Expect the air squats to make the snatches more difficult than you want them to be. The loading of the snatches should be moderate to heavy. Some athletes may be able to perform a few touch-and-go reps, however, most will find success in performing quick singles.

**Scaling:**
Reduce the load of the barbell to complete the first 10 snatches in 2 minutes or less. Reduce the reps of the air squats to complete each set in 1:30 or less. Reduce the complexity of the snatch by performing a hang snatch. In case of injury or limitation, perform a hang snatch or single-arm dumbbell snatch in place of the snatch. For the air squats, consider squatting to a target, or performing a lunge or a box step-up.

"Monday 241216","50-35-20 reps for time of:  
Hand-release push-ups  
Row calories

Post time to comments.

**Stimulus and Strategy:**
Today’s workout is a play on last Monday’s effort. It’s also a sprint. Both workouts are simple gymnastics movements followed by a sprint on a piece of monostructural equipment. However, last Monday was a pulling gymnastics function and today is pressing. Like last week, do not “game” the workout. Move as quickly as possible through the push-ups and the row. Choose options that allow you to finish in 12 minutes or less.


**Scaling:**
Reduce the reps of both the hand-release push-ups and the calories on the rower to keep the round of 50 under 3 minutes for each movement.
Perform the hand-release push-ups from the knees or perform regular push-ups with your hands on a stable 30-inch box and your feet on the floor.
In case of injury or limitation, perform a single-arm dumbbell floor press in place of the hand-release push-up. If you do not have a rower, choose any other machine or run 400/300/200 meters, respectively.

**Intermediate option:**  
**35-25-15** reps for time of:   
Hand-release push-ups   
Row calories

**Beginner option:**    
**20-15-10** reps for time of:   
Hand-release push-ups **from the knees**

**Coaching cues:**
In the push-up, the entire body should travel up and down together. To ensure the upper and lower body are connected, squeeze your quads, glutes, and abdominals throughout the movement.

Metabolic conditioning (met-con) is a cornerstone of CrossFit, designed to optimize your body’s ability to store, deliver, and use energy efficiently across varying intensities and durations. By targeting all three energy systems, met-cons boost energy efficiency, enhance fitness, support heart and lung health, promote fat loss while preserving muscle, and prepare you for real-world physical demands. Best of all, CrossFit-style met-cons build exceptional endurance without the need for traditional endurance training.

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
In today’s workout, you need to push the pace in order to start working on your score. Set up a farmers carry route that is 50 feet out and 50 feet back. As soon as you get back, put your dumbbells down, put your toes under the dumbbell handles, and begin your sit-ups. The goal is to have at least 30 seconds to perform squat cleans. So, reduce the distance of the carry and reps of the sit-ups as needed. As for the loading of the dumbbells, you should be able to hang on for the entire farmers carry and perform at least 7 squat cleans before needing a quick break. If in doubt today, go lighter and do more reps.

**Scaling:**  
For today’s Hero workout, reduce the weight on the push presses and kettlebell swings, and the height of the box so you can perform each exercise unbroken with minimal rest during transitions. Don’t let the load keep you from moving — the goal is constant movement for the duration of the workout.

[Hitting the Stimulus in Every CrossFit WOD](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-hitting-the-stimulus?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  

Intensity and variance are essential to CrossFit programming, driving results and fostering broad fitness. Preserving the intended stimulus of each workout ensures we optimize both elements. Factors like how a workout feels, loading, timing, volume, and movement patterns play a crucial role. The math method helps scale workouts to maintain intensity, guiding athletes to hit the desired time or rep targets. Whether tackling Fran, Cindy, or Amanda, scaling appropriately ensures athletes achieve the intended stimulus, maximizing fitness and results over the long term.

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a gymnastics couplet that falls in the moderate time domain. Expect the combination of being upside down, then squatting on one leg to be a bit disorienting. Remember to breathe, get your balance, and keep moving. Reduce the volume and movement complexity for wall walks to finish all reps in 2 minutes or less. As for the single-leg squats, reduce volume and change to alternating reverse lunges if needed to keep moving at a steady pace and finish in 2 minutes or less.

[The Deadlift](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-deadlift-2)  

The deadlift, a fundamental hinging movement pattern, is highly effective for building strength, increasing muscle mass, improving back health, and enhancing athletic performance. Engaging major muscle groups like the glutes, hamstrings, and spinal erectors, the deadlift supports full-body strength and resilience. Regular deadlift training promotes muscle growth and reduces back pain by strengthening the spine and surrounding muscles. It also boosts athletic abilities, improving speed, power, and midline stability essential for sports. By incorporating deadlifts consistently, you can achieve significant improvements in strength, health, and overall fitness.

Today’s workout is a “choose your own adventure.” Break up the reps and switch exercises in any fashion you choose. Expect the burpees to conflict with the wall-ball shots with regard to the pressing of the burpee and the throwing of the med ball. Because of this, you may consider smaller sets of each movement with more switching back and forth. Choose a loading for the wall-ball shots that allows you to complete at least 10 unbroken reps every time you pick it up. As for the burpees, breaking up 150 reps into smaller sets looks less daunting. Find a rep scheme that works for you.

Improving mobility is essential for performance and injury prevention in CrossFit, but athletes often make mistakes that slow their progress. Common errors include failing to identify specific mobility limitations, over-relying on passive techniques like foam rolling, and neglecting strength work to reinforce new ranges of motion. By assessing specific areas, using effective stretching techniques, and incorporating heavy, controlled movements, athletes can enhance their mobility more efficiently and see better results in their workouts.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout got its inspiration from a Hero workout called Michael. We are still going to run 800 meters, however, we are going to do it at the end of the round to encourage you to move a little quicker, especially in the final round. The dumbbell deadlifts are replacing the back extensions and we’re doing GHD sit-ups instead of AbMat sit-ups. The loading of the dumbbells should be light and allow you to complete your reps in 3 sets or less. Some may be able to go unbroken. If you are not consistently using the GHD, it is not recommended to attempt the prescribed option. Scale the range of motion and the number of reps.

**Coaching cues:**  
You should never lose the engagement of your abdominals as you lay back to perform a rep on the GHD. Choose a range of motion that allows you to stay engaged through your mid-section. While a wacky inflatable arm man is mesmerizing, it is never a good technique for your midline.

"Tuesday 241203","Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 9 minutes of:
3 bar muscle-ups  
6 box jump-overs 

♀ 24-inch box  
♂ 30-inch box

Post reps to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a gymnastics couplet. Simple, yet effective. Because the duration of the workout is relatively short, this is not a good workout to “try something new.” If you have bar muscle-ups and 3 reps per round is too many, scale to 1 or 2 reps per round. In this effort, you should choose movements that allow you to complete a round at least every minute. That being said, we may see scores from advanced athletes in the high teens because they are able to complete a round every 30 seconds. Push the pace from the start and don’t try to “game” this one.

**Intermediate option:**

♀ **12**-inch box

**Coaching cues:**  
The bar muscle-up tends to be elusive because unlike the rings, you must move your body around the bar. To do this more efficiently, imagine pressing the bar into your hips as you rotate around the bar.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout pairs a weightlifting element with a monostructural element. The row distances are short enough that they deserve to be pushed and not paced. The loading of the overhead squat sits on the light-to-moderate side. The barbell should be taken from the floor and the weight you choose should allow you to complete your reps in 2 sets or less. The goal is less looking at the bar and more moving it. The final row should be an all-out sprint!

[Myths About Aging](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-myths-about-aging)  

Contrary to misconceptions, older athletes can increase strength, improve physical capacity, and benefit from training with intensity, which helps reduce injury risks and maintain muscle mass. Complex movements like gymnastics and weightlifting are crucial for improving coordination, agility, and balance, especially as neurological skills become harder to develop with age. While recovery may take longer for older athletes, proper lifestyle choices like good nutrition, sleep, and stress management allow older athletes to train hard and recover effectively, making CrossFit scalable and transformative for all ages.

1-minute handstand hold  

♀ 105 lb  
♂ 155 lb

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a combination of lifting and static holds. You will also notice the pull-up bar hang is after the hang power cleans (pulling and grip intensive). Then the handstand hold is after the push jerks (pressing intensive). Because of this design, a moderately loaded barbell will begin to feel significantly heavier and the holds will test your stamina with the related movement functions. Complete the handstand holds against a wall. Scale the loading and duration of the holds so a single round takes no more than 5 minutes to complete.

Today’s workout is a classic chipper-style effort. Some may recognize it as the “Dirty Thirty” with an added row to begin the workout. The goal is to make it as far through this workout as possible within the allotted time. Some may even finish the double-unders and get an opportunity to get back on the rower. However, most should aim to make it to the wall-ball shots and get as many reps as possible before time runs out. To hit this stimulus, the row should take no more than 6 minutes to complete.

In the final article in this six-part series, we discuss how following CrossFit’s fitness and dietary guidelines not only enhances physical performance but also fortifies your body’s immune system. Protein is vital in this process, supporting immune cell production and function. High-quality animal proteins provide essential amino acids like glutamine, arginine, and cysteine, critical for immune defense and recovery. This holistic approach to health strengthens your body against chronic diseases and acute illnesses alike, making fitness a lifelong pursuit.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a classic pull and push movement combination. In theory, you should be able to go back and forth between movements with minimal interference. Tread lightly in the first few rounds as they will go by very quickly. However, the later rounds are a different story. The loading of the barbell should be light to moderate and allow you to perform most of your sets unbroken. As for the ring dips, if you are going to do these as prescribed, we recommend you be able to complete consistent sets of 3 or more unbroken reps. To reduce the difficulty of the ring dips, consider jumping dips or foot-assisted dips.

♀ 105-lb barbell  
♂ 155-lb barbell

Post reps to comments.  

**Scaling:**  
In today’s workout, you have four exercises with 4 minutes at each exercise. The goal is to complete as many reps of each exercise as possible. Choose a load for the barbell that allows you to move more and stare at it less. Use the same load for both the overhead squats and the thrusters. It's OK if one feels a little lighter than the other — this just means you should get more reps. For the barbell movements, aim for at least 7 reps per minute. On the rope climbs, choose an option that allows you to perform at least 2 reps per minute. For the wall walks, choose an option that allows you to perform at least 3 reps per minute. Keep in mind that more advanced athletes will be able to perform more reps. However, the numbers outlined above should help you choose appropriate scaling options to get the most out of the workout.

**Intermediate option:**    
For total reps:  
4 minutes of overhead squats  
4 minutes of rope climbs to **12** feet  
4 minutes of thrusters  
4 minutes of wall walks

♀ **75**-lb barbell  
♂ **115**-lb barbell

**Beginner option:**   
For total reps:  
4 minutes of overhead squats  
4 minutes of **lying-to-standing**  
4 minutes of thrusters  
4 minutes of **inchworms + push-ups from the knees**

♀ **35**-lb barbell  
♂ **45**-lb barbell

**Coaching cues:**  
Keep the barbell over the middle of the body as you overhead squat. Press up into the bar and pull back on it slightly to keep it situated over the middle of your feet. Your ability to balance and keep a stable base will let you know if the barbell is in the right position.

[Primer on Protein, Part 5: Antioxidants](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/protein-part-5-antioxidants?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  

Part 5 of the ""Primer on Protein"" series focuses on the role of protein in the body’s antioxidant system. CrossFit’s nutrition prescription emphasizes protein-rich foods like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy, which provide essential amino acids that help the body build tissues, hormones, and immune cells. A key component of the body’s defense against oxidative stress, caused by free radicals, is the production of antioxidants like glutathione and melatonin. Consuming enough dietary protein supports the body's ability to fight oxidative stress, helping to protect against chronic diseases, aging, and injury while enhancing overall performance.

Post times to comments.

**Scaling:**  
The name of the game in today’s workout is consistency — be smooth on the rower, in control on the double-unders, and knock out bigger chunks of reps on the GHD. All athletes should aim to keep this workout under 20 minutes. More advanced athletes are challenged to go 15 minutes or less. If you are not accustomed to the GHD, look to reduce reps and range of motion. Athletes who are working on their double-unders should spend no more than 2 minutes working with the jump rope in each round.

**Intermediate option:**    
3 rounds for time of:  
400/500-meter row  
**2 minutes** of double-under **attempts**

**Beginner option:**   
3 rounds for time of:  
**200/250**-meter row  
**60 single**-unders  
**20 good mornings (PVC or empty barbell)**

**Coaching cues:**  
Imagine a string between your sternum and your belly button. If those two landmarks stay far away from each other, the string stays tight. When those two landmarks get closer together, the string is loose. During the GHD hip extensions, keep the string tight.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout challenges you to push the pace on each run and go unbroken on the couplet in the middle. Do your best not to “game” this workout. Instead, hit the first run hard and then get ready to find your hip flexors. Choose an option for the toes-to-bar that allows you to complete each round in 2 sets or less. As for the box jump-over, use a height that allows you to keep moving and finish your reps in less than a minute. On the last run, give it everything you have left.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a classic CrossFit benchmark. Its nickname is “the three bars of death.” The earlier rounds of this workout are a bit of a grind. Go unbroken where you can and manage your reps when you need to catch your breath. For example, singles on the squat cleans are a great way to manage your heart rate and prepare yourself for the next round. This effort contains a high volume of weightlifting at a moderate load. Reduce the loads and/or eliminate some of the early rounds to decrease the total volume. If you are able, use a spotter when performing the bench presses. This is purely a safety consideration. If you are unable to find a spotter, do not push to failure and break before you think you need to.

**Intermediate option:**

[The Primer on Protein: Part 4 - Joints](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/protein-part-4-joints?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  


Part 4 of the ""Primer on Protein"" series focuses on the importance of dietary protein for maintaining healthy joints and connective tissues. Protein, particularly collagen, plays a crucial role in supporting tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and fascia, which enable smooth and pain-free movement. Collagen is built from amino acids like glycine and proline, found in foods such as slow-cooked meats, bone broth, and skin-on poultry or fish. Without adequate intake of these collagen-building nutrients, connective tissue can weaken, leading to joint pain, stiffness, and an increased risk of injury or osteoarthritis. By consuming protein-rich foods, we ensure strong, flexible, and resilient connective tissue, promoting long-term health and mobility.

Today’s workout is a gut check. Find a pace on both the rower and the burpees you can maintain and keep yourself moving. Going out “hot” on the rower does you no good if your pace slows down your burpees. Most can perform the movements as prescribed, however, consider a combination of reps and calories that allows you to finish a round in 4 minutes or less.

Part 3 of the ""Primer on Protein"" series emphasizes the crucial role of protein in supporting mental health alongside physical health. Protein-rich foods like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy provide essential amino acids, such as tryptophan and tyrosine, which are vital for producing key neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. Serotonin promotes a positive mood and resilience, while dopamine drives motivation and focus. A lack of these amino acids can negatively impact mental well-being, contributing to conditions like depression and anxiety. CrossFit’s nutrition prescription prioritizes high-quality protein intake to support both physical and mental health.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a gymnastics endurance and stamina tester. Expect both the muscle-ups and the handstand walk to not play nicely with one another. With that in mind, consider your strategy for this workout. Do you go unbroken on the muscle-ups? If you do, do you have the pressing stamina to kick right up and start your handstand walk? Or are you better off breaking up your muscle-ups to preserve more gas in the tank for the handstand walk? These are questions you need to consider. Take fatigue into consideration. If you need an extra break before kicking up into a handstand or jumping up on the rings, do it. You know your body best.

Delay the transition a little longer than you want to. This means letting your hips and momentum in the swing carry you as high as possible before transitioning to the bottom of the dip. This will help you last longer and maybe help you get a few extra reps.

In Part 2 of the ""Primer on Protein"" series, the focus shifts to the role of dietary protein in bone health. CrossFit’s nutrition prescription highlights the importance of animal foods (meat, fish, eggs, etc.), which provide high-quality protein. Protein-rich foods, especially those cooked on the bone or containing skin, provide key amino acids necessary for bone health. Diets lacking these foods can lead to lower bone density and increased fracture risk, while high protein intake, especially in older adults, is associated with stronger bones and reduced risk of osteoporosis.

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is another weightlifting and gymnastics couplet. It is actually a play on Wednesday’s workout. On Wednesday, we had movement interference with the pull of the deadlift and the pull of the strict pull-up. It was also very grippy. 

Today, you will find movement interference with the pressing in the overhead position of the snatch and the pressing of the strict handstand push-up. The power snatch loading should be moderate and allow you to perform a few touch-and-go reps, as well as a few singles here and there. For the strict handstand push-ups, we recommend you be able to perform consistent sets of 5 reps unbroken if you are going to tackle the prescribed number of reps.

Movement interference is not something programmed regularly as it tends to slow us down and decrease intensity. However, movement interference does a great job of building muscular stamina and endurance.

Just because a movement is strict does not mean it has to be slow. As soon as your head touches the ground on the strict handstand push-ups, squeeze everything tight, push your hands into the ground, and push your head through your arms to finish the rep.

"Friday 241108","3 rounds for time of:  
35 GHD sit-ups  
70 double-unders  
400-meter run  

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a bit of a midline burner. Expect the GHD sit-ups to challenge your posture for the double-unders and the run. This will force you to put extra emphasis on maintaining better posture and a rigid midline throughout the workout. With that said, if you are not accustomed to the GHD, you should consider scaling the reps and range of motion. If you struggle with double-unders, do not spend more than 2 minutes working on this movement. Instead, spend the 2 minutes accumulating attempts and then move on to the run after time is up.

**Intermediate option:**    
3 rounds for time of:  
**25** GHD sit-ups **to parallel**  
**40** double-unders  
400-meter run

**Beginner option:**   
3 rounds for time of:  
**20 sit-ups**  
**40 single**-unders  
**200**-meter run

**Coaching cues:**  
As your midline gets fatigued, you might begin to “slouch” with your posture on your double-unders. This makes it difficult to breathe and recover. Focus on keeping a forward gaze and being as upright as possible when you are performing double-unders.

[The Primer on Protein, Part 1: What Is Food For](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/protein-part-1?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod) 

In ""World Class Fitness in 100 Words,"" the first prescription for achieving fitness is focused on food, not exercise, highlighting the importance of nutrition. While food provides energy, it also offers crucial building blocks for the body, like amino acids, which form proteins essential for brain, muscle, and tissue function. This series explores how dietary protein supports muscle health, which is vital for longevity and disease prevention.

Deadlifts  
Strict pull-ups

♀ 155 lb  
♂ 225 lb

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a gymnastics and weightlifting couplet. Most should finish this effort in 10 minutes or less. For those proficient with these movements, it will be a sprint. However, if you can perform at least 7 reps with the prescribed deadlift weight and consistent sets of 5 unbroken strict pull-ups, then you should hit this workout as written. It might not be a sprint, but it will be an opportunity to build capacity in these two movements. If you cannot hit those targets, reduce the loading of the barbell and the difficulty of the strict pull-up.

**Intermediate option:**    
For time:  
21-15-9 reps  
Deadlifts  
**12-9-6** reps

**Beginner option:**   
15-12-9 reps for time of:   
Deadlifts  
Ring rows

♀ **55** lb  
♂ **75** lb

**Coaching cues:**  
In the deadlift, delay the knee bend on the return of the barbell. After you stand up the load, unlock your knees and then focus on sending your hips back while keeping your chest up. You should feel tension in your glutes and hamstrings — this is good. Once the bar passes the knees, you can bend the knees and return the barbell to the floor.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a longer effort with a large volume of bodyweight movements. This effort will be very similar to a workout like Cindy where you are moving at a steady pace for 20 minutes. All athletes should aim to complete a single round in 5 minutes or less. If the prescribed exercises don’t allow for this, scale the reps and/or difficulty of the movement. For example, scale the toes-to-bars by reducing the reps or performing 20 hanging knee raises. Work hard and have fun with this one.

**Coaching cues:**  
Master the basics. The air squat is a simple yet effective movement. Don’t knock it just because it is “easy.” Challenge yourself to maintain solid mechanics. The hips move back and down, heels down, knees out, lumbar arch maintained, and hips finish below the knees. Don’t skimp on these points of performance.

Today’s workout is a sprint effort. No pacing. Most know what they are capable of if they “game” the bike. However, it becomes a different story and maybe a little more scary when you dance with the unknown. The loading of the barbell should be moderate and allow you to complete the weightlifting portion of this workout with quick sets and minimal rest. Adjust load to spend no more than 4 minutes on the 20 clean and jerks, allowing for a rep at least every 12 seconds.

[Putting “The Hopper” and Your Fitness to the Test](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-hopper-fitness-test?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  

CrossFit emphasizes developing broad, general fitness, avoiding specialization to handle any challenge life presents. While athletes like triathletes excel in specific sports, such specialization often leads to weaknesses in other areas. CrossFit's ""hopper model"" promotes balanced fitness, preparing athletes to perform well across a variety of tasks, while testing fitness outside the gym fosters a sense of accomplishment and adheres to CrossFit's ""Fitness in 100 Words,"" which encourages athletes to learn and try new sports regularly.

Today’s workout is a weightlifting and gymnastics couplet. Because of the lower repetitions in each set, expect to perform at least 5 rounds. The barbell should come from the ground and the loading should be moderately heavy. Choose a load that enables you to perform all 5 reps unbroken every time you pick up the barbell.

Conventional beliefs about aging often depict it as an inevitable decline into frailty, with losses in muscle, bone density, strength, and coordination, alongside an increase in illnesses. However, CrossFit has demonstrated that aging does not need to equate to deterioration. Through constantly varied functional movements performed at high intensity and paired with sound nutrition, older athletes can improve their fitness at any age, preserving independence, balance, and strength while mitigating risks like falls and chronic diseases.

The dumbbell weight should be relatively light and begin to tax your grip around the 30- to 40-rep range.

Most athletes can complete this lifting day as prescribed. Newer athletes should start light, focus on mechanics, and slowly add weight as they are comfortable.

Considering the heavy loading of the barbell, you are encouraged to find a spotter. However, if you are not able to find a spotter, use some type of guard rails or simply reduce the load to something you can manage without a spotter.

Post time to comments.  

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout will test your grip and climbing technique. If you rely a lot on your arms during the rope climb, you will find yourself waiting for your grip to recover. However, if you focus on a secure foot hold and staying close to the rope, you will be able to keep moving and post a fast time. Choose a toes-to-bar option that allows you to complete the reps in 2 sets or less. As for the dumbbell snatches, the load should be light to moderate and allow you to get through 20 reps in 2 sets or less. If you can go unbroken, do it.

**Intermediate option:**    
5 rounds for time of:

♀ **10** lb  
♂ **15** lb

**Coaching cues:**  
Before standing up on your foot hold, make sure it is secure. In other words, make sure to pull the rope tight to the foot and take out any slack. Pinch the feet together, secure the hook, and then stand up. Over time, this process gets faster, but you must develop good habits at slower speeds first. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.

[CrossFit is Health: Using CrossFit to Rehab an Injury](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-is-health?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  

CrossFit takes a holistic approach to injury rehabilitation, focusing on maintaining overall fitness while allowing the injured area to heal. Rather than sidelining the athlete, workouts are modified to exclude the injured part, ensuring fitness improves through varied, high-intensity exercises. This method not only enhances physical healing but also helps the athlete address weaknesses, turning the injury into an opportunity for growth. Once the injured area is ready, it is gradually reintegrated into workouts, resulting in a fitter, healthier athlete than before the injury. CrossFit’s approach promotes faster healing, reduces atrophy, and keeps athletes mentally engaged throughout recovery.

**Scaling:**  
This classic benchmark contains a high volume of a light weightlifting movement. Choose a load that allows you to hang on for large sets. Consider strategic breaks as a way to keep yourself moving and avoid longer periods of hook-gripping your shorts. Remember, one more rep is one rep closer to finishing the workout. Be sure to look back at your previous score to help you better understand your strategy for today’s effort.

**Coaching cues:**  
Oftentimes in this workout, it's the shoulders and arms that cause you to take more breaks. Immediately after releasing the ball, consider bringing your arms back down toward your shoulders. Take a quick breath, and get ready for the ball to return. Repeating this across larger sets can delay shoulder fatigue.

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout will look different for different ability levels. While an advanced athlete may be able to “sprint” through, for other athletes, this may be more of a skill day — an opportunity to practice new skills or push the margins of experience out a bit further. Choose an option for the run that allows you to finish in 10 minutes or less. If you do not spend a lot of time on the GHD, scale the number of reps and range of motion. If you do not have access to a GHD, consider performing good mornings either unloaded or at most with an empty barbell. When it comes to the freestanding handstand hold, choose an option that allows you to hold for at least 15 seconds. That said, if you want to try the freestanding handstand, but you can only hold for a few seconds at a time, simply scale the time you accumulate. Have fun with this one and step outside your comfort zone.

**Intermediate option:**    
For time:

Today’s workout is a Tabata workout. The most common one is Tabata Something Else. You will perform all 8 sets of an exercise before moving on to the next. A single set is 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of rest. The goal is to accumulate as many reps as possible within the 20 seconds and across all 8 sets. At the end of your workout, your score will be the total number of reps you completed across all four exercises. When it comes time for the box jump-overs, the safest option is to step down.

The air squat is a fundamental movement critical to maintaining mobility and joint health in the ankles, knees, and hips. It is essential for daily activities like sitting and standing, and athletic movements such as running and jumping. Proper technique is key, starting with feet shoulder-width apart, maintaining a neutral spine, and squatting to a depth where the hips are lower than the knees. Mastery of the air squat is crucial before progressing to weighted variations, as it impacts long-term fitness and health, and regular practice is essential for continual improvement.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a gymnastics couplet with ascending reps. Don’t be fooled by the first few rounds — this workout will get spicy soon enough. To find the target for the burpees, extend your arms over your head and find a target about 6 inches above your fingertips. As for the GHD sit-ups, go into this workout with a number of reps appropriate for you. If you hit that number, finish the workout with just burpees. If you do not spend a lot of time on this piece of equipment, scale the number of reps and range of motion. The GHD is an amazing piece of equipment, but respect its power.

**Coaching cues:**  
On the GHD sit-up, lower yourself down with bent legs and as soon as you reach the bottom of your rep, brace your midline and straighten the legs by squeezing your thighs and driving your heels toward the wall in front of you. This rapid extension of the legs helps incorporate bigger muscle groups and helps protect the lower back.

Today’s workout is a play on Wednesday’s with a reverse rep scheme, but still a heavy sprint effort. Expect today’s workout to be slightly longer in terms of time domain, but the goal is to keep the barbell moving. Both the deadlifts and the front squats should feel pretty heavy while the clean and jerks may be more on the moderate side. When choosing loads for the workout, the deadlift should be unbroken, the front squats in 3 sets or less, and the clean and jerks should be performed in 4 minutes or less.

[CrossFit for the Sport-Specific Athlete](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-sport-specific-athlete?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  

Most strength and conditioning programs are not highly sport-specific. Most programs across sports focus on general physical preparation (GPP) by building foundational athletic skills like strength, power, mobility, and endurance. While coaches teach sport-specific skills, athletes often neglect GPP, which can significantly enhance their sports performance. CrossFit, with its emphasis on functional movements, variety, and intensity, excels in developing GPP through exercises like squats, deadlifts, and Olympic lifts. By improving general athleticism, CrossFit allows athletes to train more efficiently and enhance their specific sports skills while fostering team spirit and mental toughness.

In the hang power clean, focus on setting up with your shoulders over the barbell. Then, stand up by driving your heels into the ground, squeezing your thighs and glutes, and getting your shoulders behind the barbell. To finish getting under the barbell, drive your elbows through quickly, pull yourself into a partial squat, and receive the bar on the shoulders.

However, today the goal is to get through 10 rounds as quickly as possible. The kettlebell loading should be moderate and allow you to go unbroken through all of your sets.

Today’s workout is a moderate time-domain endurance-based effort. Push the pace where you can. As the meters decrease in both the run and row, try to keep the throttle down.

**Coaching cues:**  
Count your stroke-to-recovery-stroke ratio. To recover and catch your breath while still moving on the rower, consider a 1-second pull followed by a 3- to 4-second return to the catch position. If you feel good and are looking to push, consider a 1-second pull followed by a 1- to 2-second return to the catch position. This strategy will help you manage your pace based on how you're feeling during the workout.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a bit of a “beep test.” While the first round is seemingly simple, each passing minute gets more challenging. The loading of the deadlift should be moderate and something you can perform 3 reps of easily. The single wall walk and 3 deadlifts should take no more than 20 seconds to complete, leaving at least 40 seconds to perform toes-to-bars. If the wall walk and deadlifts are taking longer than the intended time, reduce the range of motion of the wall walk and the loading of the deadlift. Scale the toes-to-bars to something that is not going to hold you back. In other words, if you can only do 2-3 toes-to-bars in a row before breaking, scale to something that allows you to hang on the bar longer and complete bigger sets.

[The Clean: Why CrossFit Athletes Do Olympic Lifts](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/clean-crossfit-athletes-olympic-lifts?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  

The July 2003 CrossFit Journal article “The Clean” highlights the clean as the ""King of All Exercises,"" emphasizing its comprehensive fitness benefits and accessibility compared to the snatch. The clean enhances all 10 general physical skills — cardiovascular endurance, strength, power, flexibility, speed, coordination, agility, stamina, balance, and accuracy — while improving general athleticism through powerful hip extension and the coordination of complex movements. It is also a gateway to the clean and jerk, making it highly effective for lifting heavy loads. Mastering the clean with proper technique ensures athletes reap these benefits, optimizing performance in sports and functional tasks.

Mental fortitude is a side of training often overlooked. It’s not easy to find solace in true discomfort.

Today’s Hero workout honors Senior Chief Petty Officer Thomas J. Valentine, 37, of Ham Lake, Minnesota, who died in a training accident in Arizona on Feb. 13, 2008.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s Hero workout is a classic couplet of thrusters and pulling. The loading of the thrusters should be light to moderate and allow you to perform the reps in 3 sets or less. For the rope climbs, 27 total reps is no joke. If you are not regularly accumulating rope climb/pull-up volume, you should scale the total number of reps to align with your capacity.

Scaling workouts in CrossFit doesn't mean you're not truly doing CrossFit. Scaling is integral to CrossFit, allowing athletes of all levels to participate while progressing safely and effectively. CrossFit's focus on functional movements, varied workouts, and intensity is very different than other exercise programs, and it's also the reason CrossFit helps people get results they've never gotten.

50 GHD sit-ups  
100 double-unders

♀ 105 lb  
♂ 155 lb

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a pyramid-style workout with a moderately loaded barbell sandwiched between a few bodyweight movements. The management of the power cleans in this workout should be much different from yesterday's squat snatch workout. Today, the loading should allow you to perform a combination of touch-and-go reps and fast singles. Push to finish the power cleans in 3 minutes or less. As for the GHD sit-ups, if you are not regularly performing this movement, you should scale the reps and range of motion.

Coaching in CrossFit is a continuous journey of growth and development, where success relies on fostering critical thinking, lifelong learning, and giving constructive feedback. Elite coaches like Nicole Christensen exemplify the importance of always evolving, understanding that even with years of experience, there is more to learn. Structured feedback, ongoing education, and embracing responsibility are key components in developing great coaches who not only improve their own skills but also enhance the gym experience for members. By fostering a culture of continuous improvement and mentorship, CrossFit gyms can ensure long-term success and stronger athlete-coach relationships.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a longer endurance- and stamina-based effort. The run distance stays the same and the difficulty of the pull-up increases. For athletes who are capable of performing the variety of these pull-ups but not the volume, consider adjusting the reps to no less than 15 and adjusting the load of the dumbbell to accommodate your capacity. If you can not perform a particular pull-up in this workout, scale to a challenging variation based on the suggestions below. Aim to keep the run efforts to around 5 minutes or less. The weighted pull-ups will take the most time; however, these should not take more than 5 minutes to complete.

Modification suggestions:  
Kipping pull-ups - Reduce reps, jumping pull-ups

[How Much Intensity is the Right Amount of Intensity?](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-how-much-intensity?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  

Intensity is one of the central tenets of the CrossFit methodology because it drives the tremendous results athletes achieve. Training intensely or at higher power outputs is key to improving any measurable fitness or health marker, such as strength, endurance, or body fat, but when discussing intensity, it’s also essential to understand the concept of relative intensity. Relative intensity is how you achieve the best results, avoid injury, and maintain overall health.

**Scaling:**  
This is going to be a grind! The goal is to try to complete each set of barbell reps unbroken. Use the burpees as a place to breathe. We suggest stepping back and up, not rushing them so you can hang on to the barbell as soon as you get back there. Hold back slightly on Rounds 1-4 so you have enough in the tank to go hard on the last 3 rounds. A good goal is to keep each round under 1:15-1:40. Elite athletes may be able to keep rounds to under a minute.

♂ 20-lb medicine ball to a 10-foot target, 55% of your 1-rep-max deadlift, and 24-inch box  

Post total ring muscle-up reps to comments.

**Scaling:**  
You should be getting at least 10-15 seconds rest each minute, with the exception of Minute 4. Break up the ring muscle-ups or pull-ups early and often. This will allow you to get more reps during your 1 minute of work, and it will decrease the chance of ripping. One minute is a long time for muscle-ups and pull-ups, so be strategic with your breaks — do not go to failure on Round 1. Stay consistent throughout all 3 rounds.

**Intermediate option:**  

Every minute on the minute for 15 minutes complete:

**Coaching cues:**  
On each ring muscle-up, lift the hips up and pull the rings to the sternum. This makes getting on top of the ring much easier. Hips up and pull deep.

[Trust the Process](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-trust-the-process)  

As CrossFit athletes, we know there’s always room to improve — whether it’s refining our technique, pacing ourselves, or maintaining form under fatigue. Additionally, the constant battle to optimize our nutrition and lifestyle to support our efforts in the gym can be overwhelming, especially when we’re eager to master it all right away. But impatience can be our downfall. The best thing we can do is trust the process.

**Scaling:**  
Take today as a full rest day if you are sore or tired. Otherwise, today is a great day to focus on leg endurance. There is a total of 1 mile of running paired with box-step ups in a weighted vest. Try to pick a 200-meter pace you can stick with for all 8 rounds, even when your legs fatigue. Get right to work on the box step-ups, then rest and recover until your next set. The goal is consistency, aiming to keep each set within 3-5 seconds of each other.

Post time and load in comments. 

**Scaling:**  
Try to relax on the double-unders. If needed, build in planned breaks on the sets of 50 and 40 double-unders to prevent shoulder fatigue and moderate your heart rate. If you get caught tripping up, take a second to relax and reset. For the toes-to-bars, pick a number you can repeat under fatigue with a quick break. The snatches should be a weight you can touch and go all 3 reps, but we recommend singles. This should be a weight you can power snatch. Focus on smooth, efficient reps, then get right back to your jump rope. 

Once you finish the workout, don't rush to add weight to the barbell. Take a few deep breaths to recover and bring your heart rate down as you start building. Focus on perfect form for each rep and a big leg drive since you will be fatigued from the prior work. The goal is to finish the first part in 10 minutes to give you at least 5 minutes to hit a few lifts building in weight.

This workout will not be won on the first row. Row hard, but at a comfortable pace. For the rope climbs, focus on setting your feet to save your arms for the strict handstand push-ups.

Today’s workout is a twist on the Hero workout DT. The goal is to get through your round of DT in 1:10 or less. Once you get to the bike, go hard knowing you have a minute of rest. Your score is total bike calories over all 5 rounds. Choose a barbell weight you can do all 6 shoulder-to-overheads unbroken in all rounds. If you choose to break up the deadlifts and cleans, we recommend 6-5-1 for the deadlifts so you can go right into the hang power cleans after the last single.

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a pyramid-style chipper. Pace yourself on the way up with smooth double-unders, focused on breathing and relaxing your shoulders. Go for 3 to 4 sets on the wall-ball shots — a good game plan could be 12-10-10-8 or 16-14-10. On the box jump-overs, stepping down off the box is a great way to moderate your heart rate to get you ready for the ground-to-overheads. The ground-to-overhead weight should be touch-and-go for at least 6 to 8 reps, though singles are OK for today. For this movement, you can choose how you get it from the ground to over your head — snatch or clean and jerk. On the burpee pull-ups, step in and out to keep moving, rather than doing a few fast reps, followed by a break. Be mentally prepared to get right back into the ground-to-overheads. The goal is sub-20 minutes for most and sub-17 minutes for the elite.

**Coaching cues:**  
In the burpee pull-up, draw a line on the ground directly underneath the pull-up bar. For every rep, aim to get your feet on that line before jumping up to the pull-up bar. As you get good at this, you can begin jumping without looking for the bar because you know exactly where it’s going to be. Simply jump, grab, and pull.

[Variance is Good](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/variance-crossfit-good)     
 
Constantly varied workouts are a core principle of CrossFit, designed to prepare individuals for any physical challenge by building broad, general fitness. Critics argue that frequent variation prevents athletes from improving, but millions of CrossFit athletes have proven otherwise, achieving remarkable levels of fitness through diverse training. CrossFit's methodology focuses on developing strength, endurance, and functional movement patterns through a wide range of activities, which complement and enhance one another. Even specialized athletes, like weightlifters and powerlifters, benefit from incorporating variety into their training. CrossFit prioritizes comprehensive fitness over specialization, equipping individuals to excel across a broad spectrum of physical challenges.

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 16 minutes of:   
400-meter run  
6 burpees to a 6-inch target  
6 bar muscle-ups  
10 dumbbell walking lunges 

♀ 35 lb  
♂ 50 lb

Post round and reps to comments

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is an AMRAP! Focus on being smooth on the burpees, breaking muscle-ups or toes-to-bars as needed, and going unbroken on the lunges. For the burpees, jump to a target that is 6 inches above your fingertips when your arms are extended. Use a dumbbell weight that allows you to do the lunges unbroken for all 16 minutes while holding the dumbbells in a farmers carry position. If you finish on the run, every 50 meters completed equals 1 rep. Aim to get 3 to 5 rounds.

**Intermediate option:**    
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 16 minutes of:

**Coaching cues:**  
On the bar muscle-ups, press the pull-up bar toward the hips and keep the body as close to the bar as possible. The further the body is away from the bar, the harder it will be to make the transition.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is interval based. Your score is the total calories rowed over 4 rounds. The work-to-rest ratio is two to one. The dumbbell bench presses should be completed in 2 sets at the most. The back squat should be taken from a rack, and the load should be moderate so you can complete all 9 reps unbroken. For the dumbbell snatches, focus on smooth, efficient movement. Try to recover and avoid being explosive. Check the clock as you get on the rower for the first round, and use that as a goal to match that for the additional rounds. Aim to have 1 minute to 90 seconds on the rower each round.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a short rep scheme, but a high volume of rounds. Even though the sets are small, it is still a fairly high volume of each movement: 40 power cleans, 60 box jumps, and 80 chest-to-bar pull-ups. 

Focus on smooth (not fast) movement and quick transitions. Check the clock after your first round — the goal is to set one pace you can keep consistent over all 20 rounds. This is a great mental and physical test! We suggest all singles on the cleans, and to step down off the box to help manage your heart rate. Aim to keep rounds under 1:10 or less. The elite will be able to keep rounds under 50 seconds.

[Are You Sick, Well, or Fit? Why You Need to Track Your Health Markers](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/crossfit-sick-well-fit-tracking?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)   

CrossFit defines fitness as the ability to perform a wide range of tasks across various movements and durations, and health as the sustained capacity to do so throughout one's life. Health exists on a continuum from sickness to fitness, with optimal health providing a buffer against disease. Tracking both performance and health markers, such as blood sugar levels, lipid profiles, and physical performance metrics, is crucial for understanding and improving overall well-being. By consistently adopting healthy behaviors, you can move further along the continuum toward peak fitness, enhancing long-term vitality and resilience against disease and decrepitude.

 [Coaching the Low Catch](https://journal.crossfit.com/article/coaching-the-low-catch-2)  

When doing Olympic lifts, it's essential to master both components: lifting the bar and dropping under it. Many CrossFit athletes struggle with the latter, often defaulting to lifting the bar higher rather than combining both actions. Learn a series of progressive exercises focused on the snatch and clean to help you develop the necessary skills to pull and drop under the bar effectively. These exercises include the snatch-grip squat press, overhead squat, and snatch balance, among others. Proper technique, mental preparation, and the guidance of a knowledgeable coach are critical as you learn and perform these lifts.

The value of the glute-ham developer (GHD) sit-up, hollow rock, and L-sit as effective exercises for abdominal and hip flexor development cannot be understated. Some believe these movements, particularly the GHD sit-up, are harmful or ineffective for targeting the abs. This article emphasizes the importance of correct form and muscle engagement to reap the full benefits, such as improved midline stabilization, shoulder strength, and hip flexor function. In many conventional fitness programs, crunches are the staple. In CrossFit, we recommend a balanced approach that includes hip extension exercises like squats and deadlifts to complement abdominal training.

This year, Terrence Ogden, founder of Project Grit, completed a 75-mile ruck with 20 other participants, including several CrossFit athletes, and was struck by how natural a fit rucking is for people who train CrossFit. Rucking builds endurance, strength, and mental toughness. CrossFit is a great way to prepare for rucking and rucking is a great addition to a CrossFit program.

**Scaling:**  
Today, the goal is to see how much weight you can hold with your legs, using a medicine ball or on a weight belt around your waist, while performing a strict muscle-up. If you cannot perform a strict muscle-up, consider a strict weighted or unweighted pull-up. Beginner athletes can work on the low-ring muscle-up progression for 15 minutes. All athletes should add weight in a way that enables them to safely descend from the muscle-up or pull-up. 

After the weighted strict muscle-ups, complete 30 muscle-ups for time. Push so you approach failure in your sets to avoid accumulating excess box jumps. With that said, if you have not yet reached 30 reps, cap the workout at a max of 6 sets.

Training at a CrossFit affiliate is an ideal scenario. Here, we have all the necessary equipment and a built-in community of friends, supporters, and coaches dedicated to our success. But even if we go to a great affiliate, that doesn’t mean we need to forgo our own gym. With a workout area at home, we can work on the many movements included in CrossFit programming any time we want. Knocking out a few pull-ups or muscle-up transition drills while watching our favorite TV show is a great strategy to improve our pull-ups or muscle-ups. Every morning or evening is an opportunity to do some mobility work and practice air squats, thrusters, handstands, or any other skill we want to master.

Post loads to comments.

**Scaling:**  
The goal here is to start heavy and stay heavy. For those who know their recent max, holding 85% and above will be a great challenge. For all athletes, and particularly those who are newer to strength days, work at a weight that is challenging, but still enables you to maintain sound mechanics.

**Beginner option:**   
Back squat 3-3-3-3-3-3 reps

To make a lift more challenging, add an active pause at the bottom of the squat instead of increasing the weight. Strength will come from the quality and the time under tension, rather than from a heavier load on a single squat, especially if you load suboptimal positions.

This is a twist on the classic CrossFit benchmark Annie. The idea is to increase the difficulty of the rope skill and mix it with a more advanced gymnastics movement. It is expected that you will trip more with the double-under crossovers than with the standard double-under. You may need to add a few singles between the doubles, but keep chipping away. The goal is to make it less than 7 minutes for the more proficient athletes, and up to 15 minutes for less-experienced athletes in order to practice these skills.

When someone asks, “What is CrossFit?,” the best way to grasp its ethos is to ask them, “What are you doing at 9 a.m. tomorrow?” Experiencing CrossFit firsthand is truly the most effective explanation. It is more than just a fitness program, it is a lifestyle that challenges individuals to push their physical limits beyond what they thought possible. Through CrossFit, individuals not only build physical strength but also enhance cognitive abilities and strengthen the mind-body connection. It serves as a sanctuary for individuals seeking a pause from life’s external stressors, offering a structured outlet managed by dedicated coaches who guide them through detailed, planned sessions.

If it weren’t for the endless supportive text messages from the members at Tarheel CrossFit, Taylor Heim would still weigh over 350 pounds.

If it weren’t for the coaches grabbing her by the hand and guiding her through recovery, Heim would still be fighting depression and an eating disorder. 

If it weren’t for CrossFit, Heim would still be pre-diabetic.
 
“CrossFit genuinely saved my life,” she said. 

At 15 years old, Heim was the fittest she had ever been. By her 20’s, she was fighting to take control of her life after facing domestic abuse.

This workout should be done after strong technique practice to focus on hip extension and the receiving position in the jerk, and bar path and the front rack in the front squat.  

Some athletes should expect to be able to complete each set unbroken, but there is still value in staying heavy if you need to break the sets of 6 and 8 in half and the set of 10 into as many as 3 sets  if necessary to preserve sound technique.

The row should be scaled to take less than a minute in the first 3 rounds, and the sandbag carry should be at a loading that allows you to grab it and go unbroken for all 6 rounds. This is a low-skill workout — put your head down and do the work. Nothing other than your desire to take a break should slow you down. If you do not have a sandbag, hold two kettlebells or dumbbells in the front-rack position and walk the same distance.

[Processed Food Seduces the Brain](https://www.crossfit.com/health/processed-food-seduces-the-brain?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  

Stephan Guyenet, Ph.D., describes how the brain plays a role in regulating appetite and maintaining body weight. A few systems are at play here: the energy homeostasis system, the reward system, and the hedonic system. It seems as though the body does a better job defending against weight loss than it does weight gain.

Eating overly processed, highly palatable foods can short-circuit these systems, leading to excessive weight gain by forcing the body to protect a body weight that is overweight or obese. What is the simple, yet challenging, solution? According to Dr. Guyenet, it is to “return to a diet of simple home-cooked food, made from minimally refined ingredients.” In other words, eat meat, vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout keeps the reps low and challenges you to keep moving for the full 10 minutes. Advanced athletes should try to perform a round every 1:00-1:30 and hang on. Less-experienced athletes should aim to complete a round every 2:00. Look to reduce the loading of the dumbbells to something you can perform unbroken reps for the entire workout. Perform the burpees over a single dumbbell (do not stack the dumbbells on top of each other).

1 power clean  
1 hang squat clean  
1 shoulder-to-overhead

-Add load as technique allows.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a lifting complex. Once you perform the power clean, the barbell should not return to the ground until you complete the shoulder-to-overhead or if you fail a rep. The goal is to build up to your heaviest weight in the complex. After completing the complex, you should have around 2:30 of rest. Take this rest time to recover and prepare for the next lift. During this time, you can also add weight, subtract weight, or keep it the same. 

All athletes should not let their intensity overshadow the importance of lifting with proper technique. If your technique is good, then add load. If you feel yourself getting sloppy, reduce the loading or try to improve your technique at the same load. 

**Intermediate option:**

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout should be a moderate time-domain effort. The 15 high box jumps are meant to be a challenge, particularly after running hard. Choose a manageable box height, but one that is a little outside your comfort zone. If you can, select a box that allows you to jump instead of performing step-ups to a taller box (barring an injury). Prior to starting the workout, practice using your hands to get down from the top of the box. Once you are standing tall on top of the box, squat down and place your hands on the box. With your hands on the box, you can step down to the ground or jump down. This will speed up your transition between reps and make the descent off the box safer.

Post times to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a twist on the classic CrossFit benchmark Angie. Expect this variation to be disorienting and require more upper-body strength and stamina. This added challenge should cause you to manage your reps and think about strategic breaks. For example, breaking the pull-ups into consistent sets of 5-10 and minimizing rest between sets. Even though your capacity may allow for more, these strategic breaks can keep you “fresh” for longer and keep you in control of your workout.

Typically, Angie should be completed in 20 minutes or less. With the added challenge in today’s variation, athletes should aim to complete this workout in 30 minutes or less.

Less-experienced athletes should reduce the distance of the handstand walks and the reps of the other movements. Consider one of the options below based on your capacity and experience.

♀ 205 lb  
♂ 275 lb

Post reps to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Lifting moderate to heavy loads under duress is a skill, and today’s workout aims to practice just that. This effort is meant to be five sprints with plenty of rest between rounds. Push to finish the calories as quickly as possible, and then work to accumulate as many reps as possible on the deadlift. Expect the barbell to feel heavier than you want it to after finishing on the bike. This is by design. Athletes should choose a weight that allows them to perform at least 5 reps in each round. All athletes should not let their intensity overshadow the importance of lifting with proper technique. Find a load with which you can maintain proper form, even when you are pushing your intensity.

**Intermediate option:**

[The Fittest Athletes: CrossFit Games Athletes vs. Olympic Decathletes](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/the-fittest-athletes-crossfit-games-athletes-vs-olympic-decathletes)   

Decathletes often receive the title of ""World’s Greatest Athlete"" because the decathlon is considered the only objective test of all-around athletic ability. Decathletes must demonstrate strength, endurance, agility, speed, stamina, and mental and emotional acuity. Reading this, those unfamiliar with CrossFit’s definition of fitness may also think a decathlete could win the CrossFit Games.

CrossFit defines fitness as work capacity across broad time and modal domains. This means CrossFit athletes strive to accomplish high levels of work across all different time domains (from seconds to hours), with any task or combination of tasks asked of them at any moment. Decathletes are incredibly gifted and very fit, too. However, the nature of their 10-event competition, which dictates their training, results in a narrower fitness that inevitably has deficiencies in areas that would be exposed at the CrossFit Games.

When this event was programmed for the 2013 CrossFit Games, it was divided into two parts: a 2K sprint immediately followed by the remaining 19,097 meters. The event tested sprint ability, endurance, and recovery all in one beautiful display of prolonged agony.

This is not a misprint. Grab a group of friends, pull your rowers alongside each other, and get started. A half-marathon row is no easy feat.

This event was a premiere for the down-and-back-style chipper at the 2012 CrossFit Games and included several unique features, such as the fat bar for thrusters and the requirement to complete a burpee between muscle-up reps. Rich Froning Jr. handily completed the event in 7:06, while Julie Foucher put up the fastest women's time of 7:43.


For most, this is a moderate-duration pyramid-style chipper. Adjust the loading for each barbell to allow you to finish the 10 reps in 2 sets or less. As for the burpee muscle-ups, choose a variation that allows you to complete all 10 reps in 3 minutes or less (e.g., lower the rings so you can perform a jumping muscle-up, burpee chest-to-ring pull-up, burpee chin-over-ring pull-up, or burpee ring row).

For time:

Run 2,500 meters  
Swim 800 meters

*Ski erg 1,600/2,000 meters as an alternative to the swim.

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Once again, we’ve thrown in a bit of CrossFit Games training! With the announcement of the running and swimming at the Games, why not give it a shot? If you have access to open water, take a training partner with you or stay in a supervised and populated area. If you’re swimming in a pool, split this workout into 50-, 100-, or 200-meter intervals to give yourself short breaks. Avid swimmers can challenge themselves to swim consistently and aim for a sub-2:00/100-meter pace. 

The effort on the swim for many is quite substantial, so it’s important to run at a comfortable, aerobic pace to not get into the water and find breathing to be difficult.

If swimming is a new challenge for you and you have very little experience in the water but want to include it, start with the swim, focus on technique, and then run with more intensity. 

GOAL: CrossFit Games training and aerobic conditioning

ADVANCED ATHLETE TARGET: Run 10-12 minutes, swim 16 minutes or less  
BEGINNER ATHLETE TARGET: Comfort of the run, completing the swim

**Intermediate option:**    
For time:  
Run **2,000** meters  
Swim **400** meters

**Beginner option:**   
For time:  
**Swim 200** meters  
**Jog or walk 1,200 meters**

**Coaching cues:**  
Think running is all in the legs? Think again. Mastering your arm movement can increase efficiency and speed. Hold your hands in a loose fist and think about swiping your fingers right along your hip bone as you send your elbows back with each step. Better yet, “lick it and stick it!” Pretend you have an ice cream cone in each hand. Lick it, then stick it in your pocket.

Complete as many reps as possible in 2 minutes of:

5 squat clean and jerks  
Max-rep feet-elevated ring rows

Rest 1 minute between sets. Repeat for a total of 5 sets.     
Use 70% of your best squat [clean and jerk.](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/the-clean-and-jerk?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)    

Post load and reps to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Five squat clean and jerks at 70% should feel heavy but manageable. Heavy lifters may need to reduce this to 65-67%. Focus on good-quality positions when you pull off the floor and when you descend into your dip. Today, the first pull and the dip are important for consistent reps. Some of you may be able to do these 5 reps in 30-40 seconds, but for the sake of today, focus on making all 5 reps identical. If that takes a full minute, that’s OK. This is crucial because we are fatiguing the upper back and core with the feet-elevated ring rows. This is why our goal today is technical endurance. We can’t use a weight that deteriorates under fatigue, so if you tend to perform less technically sound when tired, reduce the load on the barbell and control the work/rest on the ring rows. 

When we look at our favorite CrossFit athletes who seem to lift perfectly even when tired, it’s because they perform sessions like these, where the goal is qualitative and not quantitative. 

GOALS: Power and technical endurance  

ADVANCED AND BEGINNER ATHLETE TARGET: Quality reps on the clean and jerk, sets of 5 on ring rows

**Intermediate option:**    
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
Complete as many reps as possible in 2 minutes of:   
5 squat clean and jerks    
Max-rep **ring rows** 

Rest 1 minute between sets. Repeat for a total of 5 sets.   

♀ 35 lb  
♂ 45 lb

**Coaching cues:**  
Technical endurance is an athlete’s ability to maintain a high degree of proficiency in a given movement(s) throughout a workout. This could mean moving along straighter lines, minimizing errant movement, and/or capitalizing on the concept of core-to-extremity movement patterns. Maintaining the ideal technique for a single rep is one thing, but doing so for an entire workout requires time and practice. Anyone can move fast, but to move quickly with a high degree of proficiency is an art form.

[Ask a Coach: What Makes CrossFit, CrossFit?](https://www.crossfit.com/pro-coach/ask-a-coach-what-makes-crossfit-crossfit)  

Certified CrossFit Coach Eric O’Connor asserts that CrossFit’s combination of functional movements, high intensity, and variance lead to “the best results of any program due to the potency of the methodology’s fundamentals. The community is an amazing bonus,” he says, “but the methodology truly sets us apart and guarantees results.”

On a running 35-minute clock:

From 0:00-12:00

Every 3 minutes for 4 sets:  
5 back squats

From 12:00-17:00  
Rest

From 17:00-35:00

5 rounds, each for watts:  
Max watts row or bike (cap at 20 seconds)*

6 wall-ball shots  
- Rest 1:30 between sets.

♀ 75% of your best back squat, 53-lb kettlebell, and 20-lb medicine ball to a target as high as possible  
♂ 75% of your best back squat, 70-lb kettlebell, and 30-lb medicine ball to a target as high as possible

**Scaling:**  
We’re doing something different today — a power endurance workout. Our goal is to try to hit a max wattage each time we get on a machine. You’ll ramp up the machine as hard as you can and look at your watts. The watts will tick up but eventually begin to drop. Once that happens, you’re done on the rower. This should take between 15-20 seconds. Less-experienced athletes may struggle to hit max watts and that’s normal. This is why we cap it at 20 seconds. Hit a hard effort for 20 seconds with everything you’ve got, then move on to the Russian kettlebell swings. 

If you’ve never done this wattage ramp-up before, give it a go as a practice round before you start the workout to see what numbers you should be looking for.

The kettlebell swings are a great power endurance tool and the goal is to have a constant dynamic hip extension and continuous leg drive. Don’t think about pulling the bell up, think about continuously pushing down. 

The wall-ball shots are all about power. Use a heavier medicine ball than you’d normally use. Your goal will be to throw each rep as high as possible. Don’t worry too much about cycling these reps. If you need to catch the medicine ball and reset for each rep, that’s OK. We’re focused on the concentric portion of this movement and the eccentric position should be controlled to allow us maximum force when we throw upward. Have fun!

*Max-wattage row or bike means once you start to move, you want to hit a max wattage as fast as possible. You are done when the watts start to drop consistently. This should take around 15 seconds or 10-12 strokes. Cap your effort at 20 seconds.

DAMPER: Use a damper relative to your weight and strength. Bigger, stronger athletes can set the damper to 7-10; smaller athletes should use a damper setting around 6-9.

GOAL: Strength and power endurance

ADVANCED ATHLETE TARGET: 75% on back squats, max efforts on the machine for each set (M: 800-900+, W: 650-750+)

Post reps to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Some of you may quickly recognize this rep scheme, as it follows the classic 5-10-15 rep scheme we see in Cindy or Mary. We’ve got a slightly more intense format, however, splitting the effort into three 5-minute intervals. This will help with intensity, and give us time to reset and recover our grip and triceps to help continue to accumulate reps. 

Start each AMRAP from the beginning, as if you were starting from scratch. The idea is to give you a target to hit in Rounds 2 and 3. Athletes who struggle with pull-ups or push-ups can use this workout to figure out how to manage the movement. Will breaking up the movements help you stay consistent for all 3 rounds? If in Round 1, you complete 5 rounds but in Round 3, you complete 2 rounds because you had to rest longer between push-up sets, you’ve learned something!

Athletes who already know they struggle with pull-up and/or push-up endurance should look to the intermediate option. This will allow more continuous movement and potentially more successful volume at the end of the 15 minutes of work. 

GOAL: Posterior chain and pulling endurance + threshold training

ADVANCED ATHLETE TARGET: 1 round every 1-1:15, and consistent sets on chest-to-bar pull-ups and push-ups  
BEGINNER ATHLETE TARGET: 1 round every 1:30-1:40, and consistent technique for all rounds

**Intermediate option:**    
Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 5 minutes of:

**Coaching cues:**  
Keep your knees straight from start to finish in the push-ups. Lower your body down such that your chest, hips, and thighs touch the ground at the same time. Then, press into the ground to separate your chest, hips, and thighs from the floor at the same time. Start and finish each rep with your arms completely locked out.

5 rounds for time of:  

24 air squats  
16 bar-facing burpees  
8 shoulder-to-overheads  
4 thrusters

Rest 1 minute between rounds.

♀ 105 lb  
♂ 155 lb

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
In this Interval-style workout, what jumps off the page is the shoulder-to-overhead into thrusters, but don’t ignore the effect on the legs going from the air squats to the burpees. The legs will feel pretty full and this will make the shoulder-to-overheads and thrusters spicy! Because of this, you may get “toesy.”  Avoid loading the quads so it doesn’t result in a muted hip, a poor dip and drive in the shoulder-to-overhead, and thrusters that feel more difficult than they should. Perform quality movement despite the leg and arm fatigue — that’s how you gain technical endurance and become efficient under fatigue. 

Use the weight you would for DT — something moderate, a 6.5 out of 10. You should be able to perform the shoulder-to-overheads unbroken but not without some challenge. Focus on the quality of your dip and drive, whether you’re choosing to do push presses or push jerks. 

You should feel pressure in your entire foot/feet and good tension in the front rack. 

GOAL: Stamina

ADVANCED ATHLETE TARGET: 2 minutes per round, unbroken shoulder-to-overheads  
BEGINNER ATHLETE TARGET: 2-2:25 per round, consistent depth on squats, and stability on shoulder-to-overheads

**Intermediate option:**

8 shoulder-to-overheads  
4 thrusters

4 thrusters  

Rest 1 minute between rounds.

♀ **35 lb**  
♂ **45 lb**

**Coaching cues:**  
Though you might be tempted to shorten the air squat range of motion during today’s sprint-style interval workout, consider this: The bottom position of the squat is nature’s intended sitting posture and the rise to full hip extension is the foundation of all sound human movement. Powerful, controlled hip extension is necessary for elite athleticism.

Short-changing your squats in this case, though giving you more time to rep out thrusters, will only impede your potential in the long run — both inside and outside the gym.

From the synopsis: 

“The capacity to endure is the key trait that underlies great performance in virtually every field. But what if we all can go farther, push harder, and achieve more than we think we’re capable of?

“Blending cutting-edge science and gripping storytelling in the spirit of Malcolm Gladwell—who contributes the book’s foreword—award-winning journalist Alex Hutchinson reveals that a wave of paradigm-altering research over the past decade suggests the seemingly physical barriers you encounter [are] set as much by your brain as by your body. This means the mind is the new frontier of endurance—and that the horizons of performance are much more elastic than we once thought … Endurance, Hutchinson writes, is ‘the struggle to continue against a mounting desire to stop’—and we’re always capable of pushing a little farther.”

Every minute on the minute for 40 minutes, alternating: 

Odd minutes: 20 step-ups  
Even minutes: 5 x 50-foot recovery shuttle runs

If you've got a rucksack, wear it for the step-ups. One shuttle run is 25 feet down and 25 feet back and should be unweighted.

**Scaling:**  
Since CHAD1000X has been announced as an event at the CrossFit Games, why not give some version of it a shot? This EMOM version resembles a training session competitors could use to prepare for a high-rep workout. We’re looking at a total of 20 minutes of step-ups broken up into sets of 20 to help reduce the strain on the legs. 

This workout is simple; we want to target unilateral strength endurance. When workouts are this simple and for this long, there’s a mental component. The ability to stay focused and present is an important factor in endurance challenges. Having the alternate minute be a recovery minute can help us get some relief, but also helps us manage mental fatigue. 

During the workout, focus on getting the work done in that 1 minute. Remember, you’ll have the next minute to reset and refocus. 

GOALS: Unilateral strength endurance + concentration

TARGETS:  
ADVANCED: Completing Rx’d reps in 50-60 seconds  
BEGINNER: Consistent leg extension on both sides

**Intermediate option:**      
Every minute on the minute for 40 minutes, alternating: 

Odd minutes: 20 step-ups

Even minutes: **40-second recovery walk**

♀ 20-inch box and **unweighted**   
♂ 20-inch box and **unweighted**

**Coaching cues:**  
The rucksack increases demand on the trunk when performing step-ups, which may lead to the torso staying forward of the hips when on top of the box. Resist this tendency and hit full hip extension at the top of each rep to fully reap the benefits.

This workout is simple but effective. We’re using the hang snatch as a complement/antagonist to the shoulder press, and the row, bike, or ski should be seen as an antagonist of the press. The workout, however, still has a component of lower-body endurance, especially if you choose to row or bike. If you choose the row or ski erg, you’ll add an element of grip. There's no shortage of opportunities in this workout. Overall, we should see this as a lower-body, posterior-chain endurance workout. 

Today, everyone should be able to complete the 5 hang snatches unbroken. Focus on good snatch technique — use the lower body to generate momentum on the bar along with lat engagement to create a vertical bar path and fast lock out. 

GOALS: Upper-body conditioning and technical endurance  
TARGETS:   
ADVANCED: Unbroken hang snatches, 1 round every 1:15-1:30 minutes  
BEGINNER: Good coordination in the snatch with hips extending before the arms pull; 1 round every 1:30-1:45 minutes  

**Intermediate option:**

“In a world where we can go almost anywhere and get almost anything at the touch of a button, it’s easy to forget that movement isn’t merely a lifestyle choice, and exercise isn’t just for the fitness fanatics.

“You may be able to summon dinner and a ride with a few taps on your phone, but who are you gonna call when you can’t get off the can?

Post times to comments.

**Scaling:**  
There is a method to this madness. We have three consecutive couplets on a running clock. Each couplet should be completed in under 8 minutes in order to have enough recovery to continue on with good intensity. To be able to do this, you should pull back slightly on the first couplet and make sure you are not at max effort. Having a light weight and scaling the gymnastics to movements you are 100% comfortable with is important to hit the stimulus goal. That said, because you may scale to make the movements feel “easy,” you may fall into the trap of going too hard too soon.

This is  threshold training — we need to work at or close to the threshold for three “intervals.” The first couplet has 110 total reps, the second has 90 total reps, and the last has 60 total reps. The degree of difficulty of the gymnastics movement lessens, but the range of motion increases. The most important factor is you, managing your effort. Speed has a cost and we need to save up to make sure we’ve got enough left over to buy out of today’s training!

**Coaching cues:**  
If you’re finding it hard to keep an upright torso in the front squat, imagine there’s a rope attached to your elbows that is pulling up throughout the entire movement. Keep those elbows up and notice how your torso follows suit, helping you to maintain a neutral spine and sound squat mechanics.

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
This triplet is inspired by the workout Helen. We’ve got a slightly higher volume than Helen but the level of intensity will match that of the classic benchmark. This workout also has a little twist in that we’re using low volume of double-unders, a normal wall-ball shot weight, volume, and target, but we’re using a heavier floor-to-overhead movement. Although the dumbbell snatch is heavier, the volume should be low enough that athletes can perform the 12 total reps unbroken with just a bit more focus. If you do not have a heavier dumbbell, replace it with a kettlebell. 

The limiting factor in this workout will be arm fatigue. This will be most apparent in the double-unders for those who aren’t yet efficient with them, as well as the wall-ball shots since it’s an easier movement to “let up” on. 

Remember, the difficulty of the workout is the reason for its existence, so we need to focus on good quality movement despite the fatigue.

**Coaching cues:**

Frustrated with double-unders? Consider your hand position. Resist the tendency to allow the hands to move away from your body, which shortens the path of the rope and leads to those frustrating trip-ups. Instead, keep your hands in and slightly forward of your body as you relax your shoulders.

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
This is a posterior chain endurance workout. The goal here is to move with close-to-perfect form on both the swings and the run. The focus on the quality of movement will do two things for us: keep our minds focused on the present and what we're doing, and help us pace our effort in order to finish strong. 

Since both these movements are cyclical, movement patterns are crucial for efficiency which translates to better intensity as we gain experience. So today, rather than focusing on finishing as fast as possible, try to focus on finishing feeling like your last 400-meter run was your best.

Use a kettlebell weight you can move comfortably. You should be able to perform the 50 reps unbroken but may break them up to help conserve energy and maintain good technique. 

If you cannot run 400 meters in under 2:30, reduce the distance to 200 meters. If you’re new to running, you can perform a 200-meter jog/walk.

To replace the run entirely, use a bike and perform 800 meters. Avoid the rower today.

Today’s workout is a longer effort. Expect the single-leg squats to tax your hip flexors and quads, making the rope climb and run more challenging. To overcome your taxed lower half on the rope climbs, focus on a tight foot hook to minimize any amount of slippage. As for the run, focus on running taller and elongating your lower half as you head into the next round. All athletes should aim to complete each round in 10 minutes or less.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a single-modality gymnastics effort. More advanced athletes should challenge their muscular stamina and move through the reps as quickly as possible. Less-experienced athletes who have the capacity to perform a few strict handstand push-ups should look to accumulate as many as possible in a 15-minute window. Athletes without the capacity to perform strict handstand push-ups should choose modifications that work overhead pressing strength (e.g., handstand push-up negatives — no more than 30 today — standing or seated dumbbell shoulder presses, piked push-ups, or push-ups).

Just as your feet generally point forward in a squat, your hands should generally point forward in the handstand push-up.

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is meant to be a sprint with heavy legs. Athletes who are proficient with the squat snatch and fast with their change of direction on the shuttles can complete this workout in around 8 minutes. However, most athletes can expect their legs to be full of lead after the first round. Stay focused on your squat snatch technique and do not take one rep for granted. Missing a rep in this workout can be devastating. Intermediate athletes who are looking to get stronger should challenge themselves to use a heavier load and scale the reps to 5-4-3-2-1. This will be a great way to target a strength weakness. However, do not mistake the increased loading with a neglect of technique. If you want to increase the weight and your strength in this movement, your technique needs to be on point.

This longer workout is characterized by intermediate-level bodyweight movements and light loads that allow people to keep moving with limited rest. Newer athletes should reduce the volume and use movement modifications that ensure large sets and short rest breaks.


**Intermediate option:**  
For time:  
50 box jumps  
50 jumping pull-ups  
50 kettlebell swings  
50 walking-lunge steps  
50 knees-to-elbows  
50 push presses  
50 hip extensions  
50 wall-ball shots  
50 burpees  
50 double-unders 
 
♀ **16-inch** box, **18-lb** kettlebell, **25-lb** push press, **10-lb** ball  
♂ **20-inch** box, **26-lb** kettlebell, **35-lb** push press, **14-lb** ball 
 
**Beginner option:**     
For time:  
**30** box jumps  
**30** jumping pull-ups  
**30** kettlebell swings  
**30** walking-lunge steps  
**30** hanging leg raises  
**30** push presses  
**30** hip extensions   
**30** wall-ball shots  
**30** burpees  
**30** single-unders  

♀**12-inch** box, **9-lb** kettlebell, **15-lb** push press, **8-lb** ball   
♂**16-inch** box, **18-lb** kettlebell, **25-lb** push press, **10-lb** ball

**Coaching cues:**  
The jumping pull-up offers a major dose of intensity while simultaneously building strength, body awareness, and coordination. It’s easily scalable as athletes raise or lower the height of the jump and/or use more or less of their upper vs. lower body, building the strength, stamina, and skill required to master the pull-up.

CrossFit programs a three-days-on, one-day-off, two-days-on workout schedule. We know individual schedules vary with some working out Monday through Friday, some simply aiming for three days in the gym, and others working out seven days a week.

When it comes to rest days, it’s important to note that if you regularly experience improvements in the gym, your health is good, and your injuries are minimal and manageable, your recovery-to-training ratio is probably just right. However, if you aren’t seeing progress in the gym, you have chronic or acute injuries that don’t seem to go away, and you’re constantly feeling tired, you may need more recovery days.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout challenges you to get outside and move with weight for more than an hour (for most). Expect this to be both a mental and physical grind. If you’re new to rucking or a newer athlete, move at a march pace and reduce the distance to complete the run or ruck in no more than 35 minutes. If you’re more experienced, feel free to pick up the pace. For the 6-mile run option, consider your recent 5K run effort and attempt to hold a more manageable pace. For clarity, the run option is meant to be completed without load.

**Coaching cues:**

Mental fortitude is a side of training often overlooked. It’s not easy to find solace in true discomfort. Rucking, however, offers the opportunity to develop both the psychological and physical components of our fitness by forcing us to dig deep through discomfort, develop grit, and come out stronger on the other side.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout should look oddly familiar. This is a dumbbell variation of the Hero workout DT. The loading of the dumbbells should be on the lighter side of moderate and allow you to perform all 27 reps in 3 sets or less. More advanced athletes should try to maintain unbroken reps for as many rounds as possible, while less-experienced athletes should consider strategic breaks to keep moving through the rounds. For example, perform 11 deadlifts, then break. After a quick breath, perform your 12th deadlift and move right into 8 hang power cleans before breaking. After a quick breath, perform your last hang power clean and finish the round by completing 6 shoulder-to-overheads. The goal for everyone is to perform at least 5 total rounds, but can anyone get 10?

Training with dumbbells is a potent way to address muscle imbalances, requiring stabilization on each side and improving overall coordination.

Dumbbells are also a great tool to reduce the complexity of lifts like the snatch and clean for newer athletes and those with front-rack limitations.

[“The Inertia of Aging”](https://www.crossfit.com/pro-coach/the-inertia-of-aging)  

Inertia has long been an understood reality of physics. From our school physical-science courses, we know the concept of inertia as: A body at rest or in motion will stay at rest or in motion until acted upon by an external force.

The aging population is a multifaceted and compounding problem of literal and figurative inertia. We hear it again and again: “I’m too old, I can’t do that any more,” “I’m too old to start exercising,” “I’m too far gone to get better,” “I was never good at sports,” etc., are given as the rationale for living life on the couch. The elderly are conditioned to accept physical decay and limitation of mobility.

But everyone _can_ move and everyone _can_ exercise — regardless of age or limitation.

"Wednesday 240710","3 rounds for time of:

800/1,000-meter row  
150-foot handstand walk

Post time to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a longer effort. Getting upside down is much more challenging when you are exhausted. Advanced athletes should aim to push the pace on the rower. This will test capacity in the handstand walk. Less-experienced athletes should conserve energy on the rower in preparation for the handstand walk. Intermediate athletes who have handstand walks, but struggle with longer distances, should challenge themselves to grind through today’s workout. If necessary for time constraints, scale to 2 rounds, but keep the prescribed distances.

**Intermediate option:**  
3 rounds for time of:

800/1,000-meter row  
**75-foot** handstand walk

**Beginner option:**   
3 rounds for time of:

**400/500-meter** row  
**75-foot bear crawl**

**Coaching cues:**  
Row at a submaximal effort that allows for a quick transition to the handstand walk variation. Shoot to row at or slightly faster than your average 5K pace. Due to the combination of movements, try to relax your shoulders while focusing on an aggressive leg drive on the row, and potentially reduce your pace for the last 100 meters to allow for better performance on the handstand walking.

Post times to comments.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a single-modality gymnastics effort. More advanced athletes should challenge their muscular stamina and move through the reps as quickly as possible. Less-experienced athletes who have the capacity to perform a few strict muscle-ups should try to accumulate as many as possible in a 15-minute window. Athletes without the capacity to perform strict muscle-ups should choose modifications that work both pulling and pushing strength (e.g., strict pull-ups, banded strict pull-ups, false-grip ring rows, strict ring dips, and push-ups).

**Intermediate option:**  
**Complete as many reps as possible in 15 minutes:**

Strict muscle-ups

**Beginner option:**   
**10 rounds for time:**

**3 ring rows**  
**3 push-ups**

**Coaching cues:**  
Before you simply skip today, consider this: The muscle-up might be difficult to perform, but it is also unrivaled in building upper-body strength and perhaps most important of all, a critical survival skill.

This movement gets you from under things to on top of them. And when it comes to preparing for the unknown and unknowable, that might be one of the most important adaptations to develop.

Don’t have a muscle-up yet? No problem. Note today’s scaling options and dedicate some time to improving skill and building strength to get there.

[“Developing a Muscle-up”](https://www.crossfit.com/pro-coach/developing-a-muscle-up?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  

I want to do a muscle-up. Where do I start? This is a question coaches receive on a regular basis. Unfortunately, due to the wide range of starting points, there is no one-size-fits-all cookie-cutter 12-week program that can be handed out to allow athletes to develop at the same rate. Rather, a program can be developed that establishes specific goals for athletes to achieve before moving forward. The timeline is specific to the individual. 


The content outlined in this article can serve as a guideline for progressing yourself or allow you to assist others to achieve their goals. As a side note, the biggest limiting factor is patience. The process toward a muscle-up can take years. Do yourself and your athletes a favor and set small, achievable goals throughout each level to motivate you to keep moving forward and take comfort in knowing you are getting fitter each step of the way.","https://www.crossfit.com/240707",20240707

*Repeat for a total of 5 rounds or stop if you complete 50 squat clean thrusters before 5 rounds.

♀ 65-lb barbell  
♂ 95-lb barbell

**Scaling:**  
This interval workout is designed to challenge your limits — push hard for 2 minutes, then optimize your recovery to sustain consistent performance throughout each set. Aim to complete the bike segment in around 45 seconds, with some pushing for closer to 35 seconds or less. Focus on finding a quick pace on the bike that allows you to seamlessly transition to the burpees. After finishing the 10 burpees, use the remaining time to accumulate squat clean thrusters. If you complete 50 reps, the workout is over, otherwise this is a 5-round workout for max reps.

Be sure to prioritize recovery between rounds with the one-to-one work-to-rest ratio, ensuring you maintain intensity throughout. Embrace the challenge today and aim to hold onto the barbell until the very last second!

In this video, go behind the scenes with four friends as they attend the Level 2 Course. The group met through CrossFit, and they have lost a combined 600 pounds while living the CrossFit lifestyle. While none of the four initially saw CrossFit as a pathway to becoming a coach, each realized they had something great to offer to the community through coaching.

**Coaching Cues:**  
Improving performance in the gym and quality of life outside of the gym requires intentionality for both training hard and prioritizing rest. It all comes down to training smart — not in excess.
If you want to continue to adapt, work out consistently, and stay with it for the long run, it’s time to embrace the rest day.

♀ 20-inch box and 35-lb dumbbells  
♂ 24-inch box and 50-lb dumbbells

**Scaling:**  
The goal for today’s workout is to finish in under 8 minutes. Keep the dumbbell box step-ups to big sets of around 10. The 40 box jumps should be a smooth and steady pace with a step down each rep. The dumbbell thrusters at the end are a gut check. Start with a minimum set of 10 reps and manage from there with the remaining reps. Modify accordingly to meet the intended stimulus.


**Intermediate option:**  
For time:  
50 dumbbell box step-ups

♀ **12-inch** box and **10-lb** dumbbells  
♂ **20-inch** box and **15-lb** dumbbells

**Coaching Cues:**  
If you notice you land excessively low during box jumps, think about pushing your feet harder into the floor as you jump, and visualize getting your hips higher above the box at the peak of your jump. If you find yourself clipping your toes on the edge or stomping down against the box, keep pulling your legs up toward your body until you land on top.

Minute 4: 14/18-calorie row

♀ 95-lb barbell  
♂ 135-lb barbell

**Scaling:**   
Today’s workout is a 20-minute EMOM which stands for “every minute on the minute.” There are 4 minutes to rotate through, so you will do 5 rounds of each movement. Minute 1 begins with 6 clean and jerks, which should be an opportunity to choose a loading that allows for touch-and-go reps. For Minute 2, allow no more than 45 seconds to complete the 12 strict handstand push-ups. Consider modifying to kipping handstand push-ups if you’re only able to complete a couple of reps strict. Modify the double-unders to singles if needed. For the row, athletes will need to push to get that amount of calories completed within the minute. This one rewards those who start each minute on time and finish the work quickly, so move fast!

**Rest Day** 
 
Sound nutrition is the foundation of health and performance because the food we consume acts as the vital fuel for all our activities. Unhealthy eating habits invariably lead to suboptimal performance and well-being. Conversely, making the right dietary choices in appropriate proportions can profoundly improve both our physical health and performance. 
 
A frequent obstacle to adopting a healthy eating regimen is the perceived inconvenience of cooking. However, preparing meals at home need not be a cumbersome or costly endeavor. Get inspired with this simple grilled pork chop and salad recipe and check out more easy and nutrient-dense recipes [here.](https://www.crossfit.com/at-home/meals)

Snatch 3-2-2-1-1-1 reps

Finish with 10 minutes of working on pegboards.

**Scaling:**  
The first part of today’s workout presents a chance to challenge yourself with weights that push your limits. Focus completely on today's lifts — they should demand your full attention. Experienced and intermediate athletes might aim for personal records with max-effort lifts. Beginners should use today to refine technique and become accustomed to heavier weights.

The objective in the second part is to develop confidence with pegboard technique and improve spatial awareness. Take advantage of this low-intensity setting to practice this intricate skill. Advanced athletes may consider performing 1-2 reps every minute for 10 minutes. Intermediate and beginner athletes may work on pegboard pull-up variations. Try 1-2 sets of 3-5 reps of each variation.

Pegboard pull-up variations include:  
-Feet on wall, even grip  
-Feet on wall, uneven/staggered grip  
-Dead hang, even grip  
-Dead hang, uneven/staggered grip  

**Intermediate option:**  
Same as Rx’d.

**Beginner option:**   
Same as Rx’d.

**Coaching Cues:**  
Think of the snatch like a race car driving around a turn on a track. If the car goes too fast around the turn, it will run off the track. Instead, the car is patient around the turn. As it gets into the next straight away, it steps on the gas and takes off. In terms of the snatch, if you move too quickly around the knees, you will “run off the track.” You will get pulled out of position and the lift will be lost. Instead, you must be patient as you pass the knees. Once you get past the knees and brush the thighs, you can step on the gas and execute the lift.

Operation Red Wings

For time:

3/4-mile [run](https://journal.crossfit.com/article/pose-alignment?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  (1,200 meters)

Then,

16 rounds for time of:  
[8 toes-to-bars](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/the-kipping-toes-to-bar?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  
8 burpee box jump-overs

Then,

47 goblet squats 

♀20-inch box and a 53-lb kettlebell  
♂24-inch box and a 70-lb kettlebell 

_On June 28, 2005, an MH-47 Chinook helicopter carrying a Quick Reaction Force of eight Navy SEALs and eight Army Night Stalkers (members of the U.S. Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment) were killed in action during Operation Red Wings in Kunar Province, Afghanistan. This part of the operation was an attempt to rescue [Lt. Michael P. Murphy](https://www.crossfit.com/heroes/murph-workout?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod), Gunner’s Mate 2nd Class Danny Dietz, Sonar Technician 2nd Class Matthew Axelson, and Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Marcus Luttrell, who had been cut off and outnumbered by Taliban fighters during a reconnaissance mission deep behind enemy lines. Three of the four SEALs on the ground were killed — Murphy, Axelson, and Dietz — with Luttrell being the lone survivor. The other eight SEALs and eight Night Stalkers were killed when the MH-47 Chinook, coming in to aid the ground team, was shot down by an enemy RPG and the helicopter broke apart, crashing down into the side of a mountain._


\- ¾-mile run to commemorate the three out of four SEALs killed on the ground 

\- 16 rounds to commemorate the 16 service members killed during the rescue attempt

\- 8 toes-to-bars to commemorate the eight Night Stalkers

\- 8 burpee box jump-overs to commemorate the eight SEALs

\- 47 goblet squats for the MH-47 Chinook that was lost 


**Scaling:**  
This workout is meant to be very grueling and mentally challenging. The workout begins with a ¾-mile (or 1,200-meter) run. From there, it’s a 16-round couplet of 8 toes-to-bars and 8 burpee box jump-overs. It’s a relatively small amount of work for 1 round, but it will compound over time. The redundancy will make this as much of a mental test as a physical one, so keep your head in it and find a way to keep yourself going. After the 16th round is complete, the workout finishes with 47 goblet squats. All athletes should reduce the work to a level that is attainable yet challenging.

♀**12-inch** box  
♂**20-inch** box

**Coaching Cues:**  
The figure-4 position is key to efficient running mechanics. To continue to develop running skills, practice standing with one leg up in a figure-4 hold.

Keep your shoulders over your hips, hips over your heel, and the heel of your lifted leg in line with the knee.

From there, work on quickly switching legs and holding the figure-4 without changing your overall body position.

Take these positions into your warm-up and workout for Operation Red Wings, and notice the difference in efficiency and speed!

**Rest Day**

The rest day — embraced by some and dreaded by others — is in some ways just as important as the days hit with intensity in the gym.

Scheduled rest days enable us to maximize intensity in training, either because we just rested and we’re feeling fresh or because we know we have a rest day coming up.

Taking regular rest days allows us to choose our rest days before they choose us, reducing the risk of injury, training plateaus, and burnout.

It’s also important to note that while it’s good to have a set schedule, things can and will change over time depending on an athlete’s health, age, stress levels, nutrition, and goals.

Check-in regularly, analyze your performance, and make tweaks accordingly. Better yet, chat with a CrossFit trainer at your local affiliate, find accountability — both for showing up and for resting — and create a plan to maximize intensity and improve fitness for life.","https://www.crossfit.com/240627",20240627

**Scaling:**  
Today’s pyramid workout is going to be a grind with each movement effectively fatiguing the following movement. For example, the rope climbs will affect your grip during the deadlifts, while the deadlifts will tax your legs for the wall-ball shots, and so on. Advanced athletes can push to finish under 12-13 minutes. However, expect most to complete today’s workout in the 15- to 20-minute range. Choose scaling and loading options that allow you to keep moving consistently. Use a load for the deadlifts that will allow you to complete them in 3 or less sets the first time through.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout will test your ability to handstand walk under a good amount of midline fatigue. The goal here is to keep your sets on the GHD sit-ups to 4 sets or less and ski-erg calories at a pace that allows you to kick up into the handstand walk with minimal transition time. Consider modifying the handstand walk to either a bear crawl for the same distance or 5-4-3 reps of [wall walks](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/the-wall-walk?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod). Some may experience a bit of “vertigo” due to the repetitive up-and-down movements. If you don’t have experience with this combination of movements, consider reducing the reps of the sit-ups and calories on the ski erg, and the distance on the handstand walk.

**Scaling:**  
Today, we have two sprint-style chippers with rest in between. For the first chipper, the load of the barbell should feel light to moderate, allowing you to do touch-and-go reps. On the second chipper, the load should be considerably heavier with most athletes doing singles on the barbell. Don’t be surprised if the pull-ups and bar muscle-ups feel more challenging coming off the squat cleans. Modify the pull-ups to jumping or assisted pull-ups, and the bar muscle-ups to jumping bar muscle-ups or pull-ups. We want to ride the line of keeping the foot on the gas, but not blowing up on the gymnastics movements. Trust yourself and let’s see what you’ve got!

Summer officially started June 20 for those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, and as the school year wraps up and the clouds clear, many are packing their bags for summer travel. 

While summertime often means a break from routine, it doesn’t have to mean a break from fitness. 

Don’t forget to toss your jump rope in your suitcase, and pick your favorites from these no-equipment or limited-equipment workouts. You can knock these out on the beach, in your hotel room, or out in the open where you can get some fresh air and use your fitness to inspire fellow vacationers during your trip!

**Scaling:**  
Today’s chipper-style workout challenges you to get through the first three exercises before you can earn a score. If you want more time with the box step-ups, you need to move quickly. Athletes should reduce the distance of the ruck, the difficulty of the toes-to-bars, and the load of the push jerks to give themselves at least 90 seconds to perform max reps of the box step-ups with the ruck. Some athletes could have several minutes, but that means they need to be moving! Athletes should start with the ruck, take it off for the toes-to-bars and push jerks, and then put the ruck back on for the box step-ups.

Post time to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240621#comments).

**Scaling:**  
Don’t underestimate today’s workout. The medicine-ball clean is deceptive and very effective. The load should be light and allow you to perform at least 20 reps unbroken. Some athletes may be able to go unbroken on all sets. Even though the ball is light, don’t cheat the movement. Focus on hitting full hip extension and pulling your body under the ball on each rep. Sneaking under the ball before full hip extension may be faster, but that technique will only get you so far when it comes to a squat clean with a heavy barbell. Less-experienced athletes should reduce the load and reps of the cleans as well as the difficulty of the double-unders.

**Scaling:**  
This workout offers 5 max-effort attempts at each exercise, regardless of how you modify the movements. Choose something that will allow you to perform at least 7 reps of each, even as you fatigue. Give yourself at least 3 minutes (no more than 5 minutes) of rest after the pull-ups before beginning the next round of bench presses so you recover enough to get another big set. Less-experienced athletes should reduce the load of the barbell and the difficulty of the pull-up. All athletes should perform the bench presses with a buddy — spotting this movement is super important. If you don’t have a spotter, don’t push to failure.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout leaves the difficulty up to you. The intention is to sprint through the first two movements and have at least 40 seconds on the rower to accumulate calories. The load of the barbell should be on the lighter side of moderate and allow you to perform 3-5+ touch-and-go reps. Fast singles might be the way to go for some. When in doubt, go lighter and move faster. Once you are done with the snatches, get right into the burpees and try not to stop. Can anyone hold 20 calories or more on the rower? Less-experienced athletes should reduce the load of the barbell and number of burpees to give themselves enough time on the rower. Time to go visit the pain cave.

Every day, police officers, firefighters, and military service members face the unknown and unknowable, risking their lives to protect our communities. 

Firefighters need to be able to run into burning buildings and pull people out of the flames, police officers need to be able to get out of a squad car swiftly or run quickly and restrain a person under fatigue, and military service members need to be ready for combat at any moment. 

It is important these service members are best equipped to face the demands of their jobs, not only to serve our communities and country to the best of their abilities but also to protect themselves. 

That is why CrossFit was designed — to ensure people are fit enough to perform any physical task thrown at them in life and to mentally overcome challenges.

Today is a great day to practice skills and challenge yourself with new movements. Less-experienced athletes should reduce the difficulty of each movement, but maintain the movement function to the best of their ability (e.g., scale the handstand walk to a bear crawl).

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a gymnastics chipper. Move at a sustainable pace. The goal is to manage muscular fatigue and build stamina. Be sure you can perform at least 3 wall walks in a minute before committing to the prescribed version — this means finishing 20 reps in approximately 7 minutes or less. Be sure you can complete at least 1 rope climb per minute. Less-experienced athletes should reduce the reps and range of motion for both movements. Push the pace where you are able, but be prepared to slow down to avoid failure. Work hard and have fun!

**Intermediate option:**  
For time:  
**12** wall walks  
10 **rope climbs to 15 feet** 

**Beginner option:**  
For time:  
**12 inchworms + 2 push-ups (at the bottom of each inchworm)**  
**20** rope climbs, **lying to standing**

This workout is a grind that rewards a consistent and steady pace. Aim to complete each round in 5 minutes or less. The load of the barbell should allow you to perform at least 3 unbroken deadlifts every time you pick it up. The prescribed load of the medicine ball has been adjusted from the original workout to make it more accessible for the Service Cup.

Today's workout is the second [2024 Service Cup](https://cf.games/24-service-cup) workout in honor of Randy Simmons, an LAPD SWAT team member who died in the line of duty on Feb. 7, 2008. 

This is a fast, lightweight barbell-cycling workout similar to the benchmark workout, [Isabel](https://www.crossfit.com/210816). Choose a load that allows you to perform at least 10 unbroken reps every time you pick up the barbell. The load should feel light (very light for some). Reduce the load so you can perform multiple reps unbroken and complete the workout in less than 8 minutes. Athletes who are less familiar with Olympic lifting should take time to drill the mechanics of the snatch and reduce the load and reps.

This workout is pyramid-style with a moderate time domain. Use a light load for the thrusters that allows you to reach proper depth and maintain sound mechanics. You should be able to complete the thrusters in no more than 3 sets and in 90 seconds or less. Scale each element as needed to start the 800-meter run by about 7 minutes into the workout, allowing for completion in under 20 minutes.

Today’s effort is a sprint. Hang on to the dumbbell and push the pace on the rower. How long can you keep the gas pedal on the floor? The load of the dumbbell should allow you to perform at least 15-20 reps unbroken. Advanced athletes should try to go unbroken.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is in the short-to-moderate time domain. If you can maintain bigger stretches on the L-sit holds and minimize breaks, you should be close to finishing at the 10-minute mark. To stay within that window, find a variation of the L-sit hold that allows you to consistently hold for 10 to 15+ seconds before breaking. If you can hold your option with ease for 45 seconds to 1 minute, try a more challenging option. The box should be a little taller than you want it to be on the jump-overs, and expect your fatigued hip flexors to make jumping a bit more difficult. Consider stepping down from the top of the box. This is not only a safety concern, it is one way to keep yourself moving at a steady pace.

_Today’s workout was created in 2005 in memory of Navy Lt. Michael Murphy, 29, of Patchogue, New York, who was killed in Afghanistan on June 28, 2005. This workout was one of Mike’s favorites, and he’d named it “Body Armor.” It is now referred to as “Murph” in honor of the focused warrior and great American who wanted nothing more in life than to serve this great country and the beautiful people who make it what it is._

Compare to [230529](https://www.crossfit.com/230529?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod).

**Scaling:**  
By design, most Hero workouts are meant to be extremely grueling, arduous, and mentally challenging. Many contain a very high volume of reps. Keep in mind that “challenging” is a relative term and athletes should adjust workouts to align with their physical and psychological tolerances. If you are performing Murph, partition the pull-ups, push-ups, and squats as needed. Consider 20 sets of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats or 10 rounds of 10 pull-ups, 20 push-ups, and 30 air squats. If you have completed Murph previously, consider performing the pull-ups, push-ups, and air squats unpartitioned. Beginner athletes should reduce the work to a level that is attainable yet still challenging.

**Scaling:**  
This is a sprint workout that should be a balanced challenge of metabolic and muscular fatigue. The goal is to hang on to the barbell and move through each round in as few sets as possible. The deadlifts should feel the easiest of the three movements. Your capacity with the hang power snatch and overhead squat will determine your load for the workout. Choose a weight that allows you to complete each round in under 1 minute and the entire workout in under 10 minutes.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a grind — consistency and pacing will be rewarded. Aim for at least 2+ rounds. Maintain a pace on the rower that allows you to get right to work on the knees-to-elbows — a blistering pace doesn’t do you any good if you are resting for a minute between movements. You should be able to perform at least 5-10 unbroken knees-to-elbows throughout the workout if you are completing the prescribed reps. If you can perform the prescribed range of motion but lack the volume tolerance, reduce the reps in each round to a number you can complete in 4 minutes or less rather than shortening the range of motion.

Only add weight if you’re able to maintain proper mechanics.

Today is a mental grind. How deep are you willing to go into the pain cave? Can you keep moving even though your mind is telling you to quit? This workout will help you answer these questions. The goal is to finish all 21 reps in 40-59 seconds and hang on for as many rounds as possible. If you are unable to perform the required repetitions within the minute, your workout is over.  If you can make it through 15 sets, congratulations, and do not go any further. Hitting this workout as prescribed is tempting, but consider scaling the movements to finish at least 7 sets.

Spend 15-20 minutes practicing the following progression:  

* Headstand

* Headstand with knees to chest

* From the headstand position, kick upward to a handstand and hold

* Kick to a [handstand](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/freestanding-handstand?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod), hold, and lower back to a headstand

* Multiple [freestanding handstand push-ups](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/the-freestanding-handstand-push-up?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)

35 [double-unders](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/the-double-under?utm_source=owned&utm_medium=internal&utm_campaign=mswod)  
5 freestanding handstand push-ups

Post rounds and reps to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240513#comments).

**Scaling:**  
The goal today is to build confidence in a gymnastics movement and develop a better understanding of your body in space. This is an opportunity to practice complex skills in a low-intensity environment.

Setup and execution:

*Perform all stages of the progression about 1 foot off a wall. Consider using an AbMat for your head. Even though the wall is there, the goal is to use it only if you lose balance or control. Remember, we are working on a freestanding handstand and handstand push-up.

**Headstand** | Start in a frog stand and extend both legs above your body. Your head and hands will still be on the ground in the tripod position.

**Headstand with knees to chest** | While in a headstand, slowly bring your knees to your chest and then extend them back above your body.

**Kick to a handstand** | While in a headstand, bring your knees toward your chest in a controlled fashion. While extending your legs, think about driving your heels to the sky — this will build momentum. Then press with your arms to complete the freestanding handstand.

**Kick to a handstand, hold, and lower back to headstand** | If you cannot yet hold a freestanding handstand, use the wall for assistance. Once you kick up, hold for a second or two, then slowly bring your head back down to a headstand. Achieve this by bringing your head in front of your hands, and allow the feet/legs to have a slight backward lean to counterbalance. This can be completed with one or both legs on the wall for assistance.

**Multiple freestanding handstand push-ups** | Once you have successfully made it back to the headstand, attempt another rep.

Modifications:

Go as far as you can in the progression and stop when it becomes challenging. Over time, progress to the full movement as you develop the skills.

**Intermediate option:**  
Spend 15-20 minutes practicing the following progression:

* Headstand

* Headstand with knees to chest

* From the headstand position, kick upward to a handstand and hold

* Kick to a handstand, hold, and lower back to a headstand

* Multiple handstand push-ups

Rest at least 10 minutes, then perform:

As many rounds and reps as possible in 10 minutes of:  
35 double-unders  
5 **handstand push-ups**

***Perform all stages of the progression a few inches off a wall.** Consider using an AbMat for your head. The goal is to kick up and back to a headstand against the wall. If you are confident with this, try the freestanding variation.

**Beginner option:**  
Spend 15-20 minutes practicing the following progression:

* **Inchworm**

* **Pike headstand**

* **Pike handstand hold**

* **Pike push-up negative**

* **Multiple pike push-ups**

Rest at least 10 minutes, then perform:

As many rounds and reps as possible in 10 minutes of:  
35 **single-unders**  
5 **pike push-ups**

***Perform all stages of the progression in the middle of an open floor.** Consider using an AbMat for your head. To make the pike position easier, keep your feet away from your hands. The closer the feet are to the hands, the more difficult the movement will be. The goal is to practice loading as much bodyweight as possible onto the hands, and to build confidence getting upside down. If you are confident with this progression, try the intermediate variation.

**Scaling:**  
In today’s workout, we have hinging, pushing, pulling, and a moderately weighted barbell.

The load, rep range, and time domain for this AMRAP should encourage people to complete quick singles on the power cleans (bonus: singles save your grip for the rope climbs). If you can, hold on to the last power clean and go right into the shoulder-to-overheads before moving on to the rope. Use a load that allows you to perform push jerks and cycle reps. 

The best athletes can aim to consistently hit sub-1 minute rounds, with a goal of 10+ total rounds. For the majority, set a goal of 6 rounds, and ensure load and scaling options allow you to achieve this volume. 

Enjoy!

Post total reps to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240510#comments).

**Scaling:**  
This interval workout is about pushing hard for 3 minutes, then maximizing your recovery to maintain your output across all sets. The goal is to finish the row around 2 minutes, with some pushing closer to 1:45 or under. Once the 8 burpees are complete, you should have 45 seconds to 1 minute to accumulate dumbbell snatches.

There are a couple of goals for this workout:  

* Find the maximum pace on the rower that allows you to get off and get straight to work on the burpees.

* Practice fast transitions between movements.

* Build capacity toward bigger sets of alternating dumbbell snatches.

* Focus on recovery each round. With the 1:1 work-to-rest ratio, aim to maintain your output across all the rounds.

With the forced rest, push hard today and dare to hold on to the dumbbell until you hear the clock!

The good news: CrossFit is easily adapted to meet the goals, needs, tolerances, and schedule of any individual at any age or fitness level.

Post time to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240508#comments).

**Scaling:**  
In this workout, we deconstruct the dumbbell thruster into the push press and the front squat before combining them again — all paired with a test of leg and core stamina in the box jumps and GHD sit-ups. 

This dumbbell chipper starts fast and gets a bit sticky in the front squats. In order to finish in sub-15 minutes, you will need to keep moving on the thrusters, stringing together big sets. 

The accumulation of work becomes evident when you start your first couple of thrusters. Dig in and go big for the finish!

**Scaling:**  
Thirty bar muscle-ups for time is a well-known benchmark. Today, we’ll add a burpee to each bar muscle-up and sandwich them between 800-meter runs. This is a nice progression from the burpee pull-ups we saw on [240430](https://www.crossfit.com/240430).

The burpee bar muscle-up is a forgotten tool when developing bar muscle-up capacity because effectively, you’re doing 30 single bar muscle-ups. The first bar muscle-up of a set is arguably the hardest, as when you come down from the top of the first rep, you can naturally generate more swing and a bigger kip into consecutive reps. Today, the goal is to make that first bar muscle-up a little easier by practicing it 30 times.

The first 800-meter run should raise the heart rate, and the burpee will cause core fatigue and pushing redundancy with the bar muscle-up, so this workout does get grimy. The burpee quickly becomes a mental test of making sure you keep moving. Finishing with the run means we can let loose and push the pace — aim to finish the last 800 meters faster than the first.

A great goal is to complete this workout in sub-15 minutes, and those who really want to push can aim for the 10-minute mark.

On a 10-minute clock, build to a heavy Turkish get-up.

Post loads to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240506#comments).

**Scaling:**  
Today we’re hitting 5 heavy sets of 5 deadlifts. Allocate a decent amount of time to build up to 80-85% of your 1-rep-max, and then start the heavy sets. If you are moving well, increase the weight each round and aim to hit a new PR around set 4 or 5. You may also stick to the same weight across the board or pyramid up and down in load. Remember, the stimulus is to lift heavy, safely, and have fun doing so! 

The Turkish get-up is a great tool to build core strength and shoulder stability. The movement will be a great bit of accessory work to finish off a strength-focused day. Complete this movement with a dumbbell, kettlebell, or even a barbell (most challenging).

Post time to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240504#comments).

**Scaling:**  
This workout is all about the midline, and the descending/ascending rep schemes will require some strategy on how to manage your rest. 

The two movements in this workout should complement each other nicely — hip extension using the posterior chain in the swings and hip flexion using the anterior side of the body with the toes-to-bars — but with this volume, it will be a great test of your midline.

Aim to finish in around 15 minutes. More experienced athletes can aim closer to 10 minutes. Everyone should be done in sub-20 minutes.

Be efficient by driving through the heels and keeping the back flat in the kettlebell swings, and apply good mechanics to your kip swings in the toes-to-bars. Don’t underestimate the potential for grip fatigue in this workout. Have a plan for when you want to break each movement to allow you to keep working instead of taking big rest periods because your grip blows up.

Reduce the kettlebell weight and maintain volume to start, then reduce volume if needed. To scale the toes-to-bars, first reduce the volume, then perform kipping knee raises or keep the legs straight and try to get the feet as high as possible while maintaining the rhythm and integrity of the kip swing. If unable to hang from the bar, substitute with lying leg raises, bending the knees if needed.

Every minute on the minute for 20 minutes:

Minutes 1-5, use a light weight to complete:  
1 snatch pull  
1 hang power snatch  
1 overhead squat

Minutes 6-10, use a light weight to complete:  
1 snatch pull  
1 low-hang snatch 

Minutes 11-20, increase the load if movement is sound and complete:  
1 snatch pull  
1 squat snatch

Post takeaways and loads to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240503#comments). 

**Scaling:**  
The goal today is to build confidence in the snatch.

Every minute starts with a snatch pull to practice:  
- A solid setup position.  
- Hips and shoulders rising at the same time.  
- Reaching full hip and knee extension before shrugging.

In minutes 1-5, concentrate on full hip extension. We are receiving the barbell high in the power snatch position (as opposed to the squat snatch), and then practicing a deeper receiving position with the overhead squat. The goal is for the skills of this complex to transfer over to the later minutes in this workout.

In minutes 6-10, start from the low hang and try to receive the bar in a squat. We may add a little weight, but stick to the same weight for the full 5 minutes; the opportunity to increase weight will come in the next 10 minutes. Focus on being patient, keeping the chest/shoulders on top of the bar, and jumping before using the arms to pull under. 

In minutes 11-20, snatch from the floor. Focus on a sound setup position, and hips and shoulders rising at the same time before accelerating and extending the hips when the bar reaches mid-thigh — patience will be necessary to stay over the bar to reach this position. All the coaching points and practice from the previous work comes together to finish with a full squat snatch. 

If you’re moving well, add weight through the last 10 minutes, but the goal is to have no missed lifts. Do not sacrifice form for load.

**Scaling:**  
After yesterday, the goal today is to give the legs a rest as we focus on an upper-body push-and-pull couplet. 

The handstand push-up volume today is substantial, and even though we have pull-ups to break things up, the burpee element brings in some pushing redundancy which starts to bite in later rounds.

Many will aim to complete a round every minute. For the majority, a great finishing goal is 12-15 minutes.

If needed, pick a modification for the handstand push-ups that allows you to hit the first 4-5 rounds unbroken, and a modification for the burpee pull-ups that allows you to complete 5 in 30-40 seconds each round.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout pairs grunt work with barbell stamina. The barbell movement in this workout increases in technical difficulty to add a unique challenge. As you become more tired, can you maintain your technique to power through the workout? The loading of the barbell should feel moderate and allow you to complete the shoulder presses in 4 sets or less. The incorporation of the hips in both the push press and push jerk should make the loading feel easier. Choose a load that allows you to perform the movements as written and practice the more technically demanding exercises. Work hard and have fun.

**Scaling:**  
Welcome to the fourth and final workout of the 2024 CrossFit Games Quarterfinals! Today's workout is a clean-and-jerk ladder with ascending weights. This is a barbell stamina and conditioning test. The barbell load starts on the lighter side of moderate and builds its way up to relatively heavy. The first barbell should be a weight with which you can perform some touch-and-go reps, while the next three will require a bit more strategy. Consider performing fast singles with minimal rest between reps. If you are not signed up for the Quarterfinals, choose loads that challenge your ability but allow you to complete the reps at the first and second barbell. The third barbell should be tough to get through, and any reps with the fourth barbell should be considered a bonus.

**Scaling:**  
Welcome to the third workout of the 2024 CrossFit Games Quarterfinals! This workout challenges upper-body gymnastics endurance and stamina. While push-pull combos usually feel complementary, expect shoulder fatigue from the different handstand push-up variations to make the rope climbs and muscle-ups significantly more challenging. To find success in this workout, break up each movement into smaller sets than you need to unless you're an elite-level competitor. Advanced athletes should perform large sets early, but not at the expense of staying consistent during the muscle-ups at the end. Beginner athletes should treat this workout like a 15-minute AMRAP. Move smoothly through the first 10 minutes, then push hard to finish faster in the final 5 minutes. This should allow most athletes to stay consistent and avoid burning out toward the end.

Welcome to the second workout of the 2024 CrossFit Games Quarterfinals! This leg- and lung-burner workout has a 20-minute cap. Those not recording a score for competition should scale accordingly to finish within this time. Advanced athletes should push for sub-13 minutes. Find a wall-ball shot load that allows for 10 or more reps at a time, and push the lateral burpee box jump-overs to get in 10 per minute. Scale as needed to hit these ranges. Those not competing in Quarterfinals should choose challenging variations that still allow for continuous movement. Consider taking short breaks during the wall-ball shots and burpees to help you keep moving throughout the workout. This one will be all about finding the line between pushing the pace and holding on for continuous movement.

**Scaling:**  
Welcome to the first workout of the 2024 CrossFit Games Quarterfinals! Today's workout is a gut check. How bad do you want to push for another rep? None of the movements should be overly difficult or too heavy, so there is no reason to stop moving. The barbell should feel on the lighter side of moderate. You should be able to perform touch-and-go reps, however, under fatigue, you may choose to perform fast singles to keep moving. 

Choose a pace on the rower that is fast relative to your capacity but still allows you to get right to work on the dumbbell box step-ups. Your goal on the dumbbell box step-ups is to hold onto the dumbbells until the minute is up. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast. 

Remember, there is no rest between movements, so accumulate as many reps as possible of each movement but leave time to transition to the next. Plan to stop with 5-10 seconds left in the minute to transition for all of the movements except the dumbbell box step-ups. During the minute of rest, try to control your breathing by taking deep breaths in through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. If you are not signed up for the Quarterfinals, choose loads that challenge your ability but allow you to keep moving and hit the workout stimulus.

Post time to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240413#comments).

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout challenges your upper-body gymnastics stamina. Expect the fatigue from the burpees to have a dramatic impact on the handstand walks. Advanced athletes should push the pace on the burpees and try to maintain unbroken handstand walks. Less-experienced athletes should manage their pace on the burpees and rest as needed before kicking up. If you can perform a 50-foot handstand walk but can’t complete it in under 1 minute, scale the distance. Be cautious of upper-body fatigue. If you feel like you might collapse or buckle if you kick up, give yourself a chance to recover and gain confidence before continuing. Remember to continuously press into the floor and maintain an active position. Work hard and have fun with this one.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a classic CrossFit benchmark, originally created for an MMA fighter to simulate the feeling of a 3-round match. Although we are not fighting in this workout, it does pack a punch. Push to keep moving for as much of each minute as possible. Capitalize on movements you excel at and pace yourself on your weaker movements. Most athletes should be able to stick with the interval pattern. Beginners should reduce the loading and height of the box. Intermediate athletes can complete this workout as prescribed.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s Hero workout is a sprint. The loading should feel light (very light for some). Reduce the load so you can perform multiple reps unbroken and complete all the reps in less than 8 minutes.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s triplet has a short to moderate time domain, depending on your ability to manage your strict gymnastics strength and stamina. Perform this workout as prescribed if you can complete at least 3 unbroken strict chest-to-bar pull-ups and 5-7 hand-release push-ups without deviation of your midline (aka “snaking” your push-ups). The loading of the lunges in this workout should be light enough that you can perform each round unbroken. Don’t stop moving on the lunges, and challenge yourself to perform one more pull-up or push-up before breaking on each round.

**Scaling:**  
In today’s gymnastics couplet, you can choose your own adventure — break the two exercises up and alternate between them however you need. Expect muscle fatigue to be a factor in this workout. Advanced athletes can try to maintain larger sets on the bar muscle-ups, while less-experienced athletes may choose to break the two movements into sets that minimize fatigue and allow for minimal rest. Breaks and rest periods are inevitable, however, aim to avoid hitting failure on either movement.

**Intermediate option:**

This benchmark workout was [first posted](https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2003/09/19#/comments) on CrossFit.com on Sept. 19, 2003. Diane is intended to be a short, intense effort. Similar to yesterday’s Fran, many athletes have completed this workout in blazing-fast times, but don’t let that deter you from attempting the prescribed version. The load of the barbell should allow you to perform at least 7 unbroken deadlifts every time you pick it up. Reduce the load to achieve this stimulus and, above all, maintain the integrity of the lift. The handstand push-up option you choose should allow you to complete at least 5 reps every time you kick up. Reduce the difficulty of the movement by performing pike push-ups or dumbbell shoulder presses. If you scale the handstand push-up, your variation should not allow you to complete the reps unbroken (if you do, the movement is too easy).

Today, elite athletes complete the prescribed workout in under 2 minutes. Fran is intended to be a sprint. Experienced athletes should go hard and shoot for a PR! Choose a load for the thruster that allows you to complete at least 15 unbroken reps. Select a pull-up option that allows you to complete each round with minimal rest.

Today’s workout is a mental and physical test. On paper, this workout creates an ominous thought of too much time on the rower — and that's exactly what’s intended. Adjust the load of the dumbbell so you can perform at least 10 unbroken snatches. Consider holding the dumbbell in the farmers-carry position, the front rack, or on the shoulder.

Post reps to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240319#comments).

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout contains 10 sprints. Athletes performing the workout as prescribed should have at least 20 seconds to accumulate as many wall-ball shots as possible in each round. Wall walks should be quick with minimal rest between reps. The load of the deadlifts, while moderately heavy, should allow athletes to go unbroken in each round. Scale the range of motion of the wall walks and the load of the deadlifts to hit this stimulus.


**Intermediate option:**  
For 10 rounds, complete as many reps as possible in 1 minute of:

2 wall walks

_Today's workout is in honor of Navy Lieutenant Michael McGreevy, 30, of Portville, New York, who was killed in Afghanistan on June 28, 2015. He is survived by his wife, Laura, and daughter, Molly._

**Scaling:**  
This Hero workout is a long effort with a high volume of reps. Athletes hitting this as prescribed should aim to finish each round in 9 minutes or less. Focus on the movement you are performing on the GHD (back extension or hip extension). Most athletes deliberately scale the back extension to the hip extension to maintain intensity and achieve the stimulus of the workout. The back extension is a controlled movement with an intentional surrendering of the spine. Dose this movement judiciously. Advanced athletes may scale the volume of the back extension if they have never completed this volume. New and less-experienced athletes should consider performing hip extensions instead of back extensions, and potentially decrease the reps of each movement. 

**Intermediate option:**

**Scaling:**  
Today we have an ascending ladder of ring dips and burpees paired with a consistent number of hang power cleans. The load of the barbell is moderately heavy and should allow you to complete 5 reps in 2 sets or less. Advanced athletes may be able to maintain unbroken reps throughout the workout. Athletes performing the ring dips as prescribed should be able to maintain consistent sets of 3-5 unbroken reps. Expect the ring dips and burpees to cause localized muscle fatigue and the hang power cleans to be a welcomed “break.” Work hard and have fun today!

**Scaling:**  
Today’s intervals are all-out sprints on the bike with a twist — you will stand as you pedal. Expect this to add some spice to the workout. Use any stationary bike you have available (e.g., [Echo bike](https://cf.games/rogue_echo_bike), Assault bike, airdyne bike). Each round should be maximal effort. This means each set should occupy every ounce of your capacity, both mental and physical. As long as you are pushing these physical and psychological tolerances then you are hitting this workout as intended. Following each set, rest 2 minutes before the next attempt.

Post time to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240311#comments).

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout should be quick, but the beefed-up variation of the single-leg squat may cause a few speed wobbles. Use a single dumbbell or kettlebell to load the single-leg squats (athletes may choose how to hold the weight). The single-leg squats should be challenging, however, each set should take no more than 1 minute to complete. Scale the load to hit this stimulus. Each set of knees-to-elbows should be completed in 1 minute or less. Scale the height of the knees to hit the intended stimulus.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s chipper is a sprint, but expect significant localized muscle fatigue. Workouts with conflicting movement patterns are a great way to build strength and stamina — you also quickly find out how many repetitions you can do before hitting failure. If you have done the [Hero workout JT](https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2005/07/06#/comments), you’ll understand the feeling.

The load of the barbell should be relatively light and allow you to perform the overhead squats in 3 sets or less. Reduce the volume first when scaling the GHD sit-ups, handstand push-ups, or ring muscle-ups. If you modify the muscle-ups, perform a challenging variation of a low-ring muscle-up transition.

**Intermediate option:**

50 GHD sit-ups (to parallel)

30 burpees

**Scaling:**  
We are going heavy in today’s workout. Remember, heavy is relative to each athlete’s capacity. This complex is meant to be performed unbroken — once the barbell is picked up, it does not return to the ground until the complex is complete or you fail the set. Remember, a failed set still counts as an attempt. Athletes should continue to add load across as many sets as possible as long as technique remains solid.

**Scaling:**  
Expect this workout to be a grind and taxing on your grip. Carry the dumbbells however you’d like on the weighted lunges — consider the front-rack position, resting the dumbbells on the shoulders, or the farmers-carry position as potential options. Reduce the dumbbell load to move with limited rest on both movements. If you don’t have dumbbells or kettlebells available, load the lunges and carries with a 30/45-lb ruck or backpack. There are no excuses. If possible, consider performing this workout on a 400-meter track.

Post time to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240226#comments).

**Scaling:**  
Today’s chipper-style workout should be treated like a sprint. Complete each movement in as few sets as possible. The load of the barbell is moderate, however, the deadlift will feel much lighter than the front squats. Athletes using the prescribed weight should be able to perform at least 10 reps at a time. Go unbroken on the deadlifts if you can — this will really spice things up. Grind through as many front squats as possible because the more you drop it, the more you’ll have to pick it up again. Stick to a number of toes-to-bars that allows you to rest minimally between sets. Consider consistent sets of 5-10 reps with 10-15 seconds of rest between each set.

If you want to practice your handstand walk but the distance is too far, reduce to no less than 15 feet. The kettlebell swings should be moderately heavy and unbroken for as many rounds as possible.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a twist on the classic benchmark workout, Nancy. The weight starts heavy, but as the reps increase, the weight decreases. We’ll start with the barbell on the ground, which means you must be able to safely snatch it — reduce the load if this is not possible as written. The first barbell should be challenging, but you should be able to hold it overhead for an unbroken set. Some athletes may be able to go unbroken in the remaining sets — if you have to break, it should only be once. Keep the runs to 2:15 or less.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s couplet incorporates a heavy barbell and a gymnastics movement. If you have a rack, use it. If not, use a load that allows you to take the barbell from the ground and safely transition it to the back rack or change the movement to a front squat. The load of the barbell should be moderately heavy, however, once the barbell is on your back, you should be able to grind through each set unbroken. As long as you can maintain consistent sets of 5 ring dips, perform the prescribed number of reps.

Post reps to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240207).

**Scaling:**  
Time to get gymnasty. The goal of the freestanding shoulder taps is to reach a point of balance in a handstand and begin the shoulder taps. A rep is counted every time a hand touches a shoulder. Challenge yourself to reach balance before beginning the shoulder taps rather than wildly throwing your feet in the air and frantically looking for a shoulder to tap. If you struggle to find a point of balance freestanding, you are better off practicing against the wall. Performing shoulder taps with your stomach facing the wall will be easier than performing shoulder taps with your back to the wall. Scale the difficulty of the rope climbs to allow yourself at least 1 rep every 20-30 seconds.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a classic CrossFit benchmark. For an advanced athlete, each round is a sprint. Put your foot on the gas pedal and hold on. The load of the barbell is light enough that you should push to maintain unbroken sets for all 3 rounds. Remember to stand up completely on top of the box in the box jumps. Newer athletes should reduce the deadlift load to a weight that can be completed in 2 sets or less while maintaining good technique.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a fast couplet. Expect your grip to be taxed on both movements. Double-unders should not take more than 45 seconds each round. Intermediate athletes should choose a number of double-unders they can consistently achieve within 30 seconds. If necessary, reduce the reps or perform attempts for a given amount of time each round. The load of the barbell should be light. Over the course of the workout, the load may even be annoying because you want to put it down, but there is no reason to do so. Push for unbroken rounds and manage your transition times.

Today’s workout is a midline assault. The load of the front-rack walking lunges should be heavy but not unbearable — it may be a grind, but aim to perform all sets unbroken. If you are not consistently on the GHD on a weekly basis, scale the range of motion and/or reps to the Intermediate rep scheme or fewer. If you are completing this workout as prescribed, each set of GHD sit-ups should be unbroken. Because both movements should be unbroken, your transition time can make or break your overall time.

**Scaling:**  
Expect today’s workout to fall in a moderate time domain. We are performing a lower volume of squat clean thrusters, but the challenge lies in hanging on to the barbell. A single repetition is a squat clean from the floor directly into a thruster. The bar must then be returned to the ground to begin the next rep. This workout is intended to be used with a moderately light barbell to allow for large, unbroken sets. 

The runs should take no longer than 2:30. Push to complete the first 12 squat clean thrusters unbroken, or as close to it as possible. The intent of this workout is to cycle a lighter load across a large range of motion and push the pace on the runs.

Remember, the workout starts with burpees.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a repeat of an Open workout from 2013. If you competed in 2013, check your score and go for a PR. 

Both the load of the barbell and the height of the box should allow you to move through the reps quickly — the load should be light and the cycle time should be fast. A single round should take no more than 2 minutes to complete. Advanced athletes may be able to maintain 1 round per minute (maybe more).

**Scaling:**  
Today's workout is a variation of the benchmark workout Angie. You have 3 minutes to work through each movement, accumulating as many reps as possible. Your goal is to perform 30-70+ reps of each movement. Avoid pushing to failure on the push-ups and pull-ups. Consider performing smaller sets that you can maintain with minimal rest to keep moving. Choose movement variations that allow you to perform at least 10 reps per minute in each movement.

**Scaling:**    
Today’s workout is a shorter effort and twist on the benchmark workout Amanda. This variation highlights the gymnastics element of the workout and challenges your skill set. Don’t let the lower volume fool you — this workout packs a punch. The load of the barbell should allow you to complete the set of 9 in 1:30 or less. 

If you have strict muscle-ups, but you are limited by the volume, consider reducing the reps to 5-4-3 or 3-2-1. If you do not yet have a strict ring muscle-up, perform low-ring muscle-up transitions. You can increase or decrease the difficulty of these by moving your feet forward or backward of the rings.

**Scaling:**  
Today’s workout is a fun triplet in which you’ll move quickly through a descending ladder. Your goal is to finish this workout in 15 minutes or less. Move as fast as you can through the round of 30 while still remaining consistent in the 20s; this should feel fast, but not like a full sprint. 

The load of the dumbbell should allow you to maintain sets of 10 or more fast reps at a time with no more than 10-15 seconds of rest between sets. 

Complete the chest-to-bar pull-ups in sets of 5+ to start. If that can't be done for the round of 30, reduce the volume to 15-12-9 and maintain 3+ reps at a time, OR scale to chin-over-bar or jumping chest-to-bar pull-ups. 

Aim for consistency through the burpees with 10+ reps/minute. If needed, scale the volume of the entire workout to 21-15-9 to stay within the intended time domain.

Complete both 800-meter runs in 5 minutes or less. However, don't crush yourself on the first run because you need to come back to the kettlebell and get right to work. The loading of the kettlebell should allow for 15-plus reps at a time. As for the lunges, keep moving and try to go unbroken. Get moving on your final run.

Post load to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240110). 

**Scaling:**  
Today's workout is a classic heavy day and an opportunity to move a little slower relative to the surrounding days. You should aim to lift a heavy load relative to your capacity. If you know your best deadlift single, start your first set of 5 at 70-75% or higher and try to add load to as many of the sets as possible.

**Intermediate option:**  
Same as Rx’d

**Beginner option:**   
For load:   
**5-5-5-5-5**  
Deadlift  
Find a heavy load and stay there for all 5 sets.   
Work on mechanics and safe, efficient movement.

Post time to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/240108).

**Scaling:**  
Today's workout is short, intense, and grippy. The load of the barbell should be relatively light and allow you to hang on to potentially go unbroken in the first set. Try not to break any set more than once if needed. The pull-ups should feel more challenging than normal because of the pull in the snatches. Aim to complete the pull-ups in no more than 2 sets each round. This workout should be fast. Choose options that allow you to do more moving and less hook-gripping your shorts.

Chaos is a [Deka Comp](https://cf.games/23_deka) benchmark consisting of two fundamental CrossFit movements. The level of intensity reached in this workout should send you to a “dark place.”

Move quickly, but understand that 7 minutes is a challenging time frame to sustain speed. Your reps should be unbroken and methodical.

Enough said.

Goal: Upper-body endurance. Aim to finish in 10-14 minutes. 

If you are efficient at a high volume of unbroken ring dips and bar muscle-ups, this workout is going to be about the row. Other athletes will be limited by upper-body endurance. The row and the ring dips will compound, making the bar muscle-ups more difficult, so technique is key to staying efficient.

Aim for a hard effort on the row, finishing between 1:45 and 2:05. Aim for a consistent rep scheme on the ring dips whether that's unbroken, 10 and 5, or 3 sets of 5, and an unbroken effort on the bar muscle-ups.

**Scaling:**

**Intermediate option:**  
3 rounds for time of:  
Row 500 meters  
**10 band-assisted strict** ring dips  
5 **jumping bar muscle-ups**

**Beginner option:**  
Row **350 meters**  
**10 foot-assisted bar dips**  
5 **jumping pull-ups**

Beginner athletes may struggle on the dips. Scale the difficulty so you can complete sets of 5 at the start. Jumping pull-ups should be difficult enough that you feel yourself pull your chin over the bar rather than just jumping.

Post heaviest deadlift, longest broad jump, and fastest Echo-bike time to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/231213).

Lift as heavy as possible while respecting the speed work. Add weight each round.

Can you lift heavy AND move fast? This is how we do it [cue Montell Jordan].

This type of workout is fun and very challenging in the best possible way. The goals are clear: Deadlift with maxi force and bike at max speed. The broad jump is a combination of force and speed.

Kevin Bowles, our head programmer at Deka Comp, loves these sessions because they put our strength work into practice and we can feel powerful without dying out.

**Words of wisdom from Kevin:**

If you struggle on a machine either because it's a weakness or because of your size, replace the number of calories by a 20-second max-effort window. This will allow you to focus on wattage or cadence in the desired time frame rather than an output. In other words, effort is more important than outcome for today.

Post time to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/231212).

Goal: Midline and upper-body endurance. Aim to finish in 10 minutes or less.

This workout will give us a dose of humble pie. The first set of wall walks is a high number and will keep us busy for upward of a minute to 1:30. In contrast, the wall-ball shots will likely take the same amount of time each round, which means the first 2 rounds of wall walks will compound quickly. The higher target for the wall-ball shots adds an element of difficulty that will increase the demand on the core, making the wall walks much more difficult. To make things even more challenging, the arms are overhead for a good portion of the workout.

If you can't throw higher, throw heavier.

Michelle Duke, one of our coaches, is the creator of this workout and has already tested it. She has offered us some words of wisdom:

– Warm up the wall ball to the 10-foot target because that first set can take you by surprise.  
– The wall balls were enough to slow down my wall walks.  
– The shoulders will fatigue but the demand on the core had my wall walks feeling really sloppy.

This means:  
– Get a good warm-up.  
– Focus on proper mechanics and positioning for the wall walks: Tight hollow body, neutral spine and short steps.

♀ **8-lb ball** to **8-ft target**  
♂ **10-lb ball** to **9-ft target**

This workout will challenge core endurance. For beginners, the inchworm requires flexibility, a tight core, and weight transfer in the shoulders. Athletes can perform the inchworms moving forward or inching out to the plank position and backward to a standing position. The first 12 inchworms should take 1:00-1:30. The wall-ball shots should be done with a comfortable weight and athletes should aim for 10 unbroken reps throughout.

Goal: 20 minutes of work.

[Run Swim Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya3rFKxr2h4) was a 2017 CrossFit Games event where athletes ran a course around the venue and swam in Lake Monona in Madison, Wisconsin. In today’s workout, we’re replacing the swim with the ski erg.

This workout is about aerobic capacity and technical endurance. The ski erg will feel like a nice break but be careful not to become complacent.

To improve your run pace, focus on posture. Imagine a string holding you up from the top of your head pulling your neck up and lifting your chin. In contrast, your shoulders should feel lower and your hands relaxed.

If you did the [running intervals two weeks ago](https://www.crossfit.com/231120), you’ll have a good idea of your speed. A trick for this one could be to average your times on the 400-meter runs and add 10 seconds to your pace in order to sustain the effort for the next mile.

**Beginner option:**  
For time:   
Run **800 meters**  
Ski **350 meters**  
Run **800 meters**

To build cardiovascular endurance, adjust the distances to allow jogging, running, or walking within the time domain. The running should take no more than 16 minutes in total. Move continuously on the ski erg. Aim for no more than 4 minutes on the ski erg.

Goal: Technical practice and application. Percentages are based on your best power snatch.

Focus on continuous leg drive and elevating the bar. If the second pull is not executed efficiently, you won’t be able to lift as much load. 

When time starts, athletes begin with 30% of their best snatch, or what they consider to be a light weight, and work up in load using the complex of 1 snatch high pull + 1 hang power snatch until they hit about 50%.

Post your total time of all 3 sets combined to [comments](https://www.crossfit.com/231208).

Goal: Get comfortable with the burn and increase your threshold as a result. Aim for 4-5 minutes to complete each set.

To be successful in this workout, aim for high intensity with some level of consistency in all three intervals. This will be difficult but a little bit of discipline goes a long way.
High intensity is the goal but not maximal intensity. Keep some in the tank and give it everything you’ve got on the last one.

**Equipment matters** — the effort on the Assault or Echo bike will change the stimulus of this workout when compared to a bike erg.

More experienced athletes can work closer to their thresholds with less rest than beginner athletes. Beginner athletes should finish BEFORE advanced athletes without exceeding their capacities. This means a beginner athlete should have a LOWER RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) than an advanced athlete in the first intervals since beginners will not have their recovery capacities as high and trained as the more advanced athlete.

I tested this workout and found that it was possible to keep the pace up so long as I didn’t push the squats. I was using a bike erg and was faced with the realization that the 21 and 21 took almost half the time, but staying composed allowed me to hit the goal and finish as hard as I could on the last interval.

Aim to move from the strict handstand push-ups (ideally unbroken) to the kipping without breaking and complete the kipping handstand push-ups in 1 to 2 sets. Break the step-overs as needed to achieve the goal.

The goal is to move unbroken from the strict to the kipping handstand push-ups. This adds an element of speed that can be surprising. Aim to complete the kipping handstand push-ups in 1-2 sets.

The training effect will be interesting because we don't get a break on the step-ups since they are loaded with dumbbells — your upper back and rear delts will be under tension the entire time. Break up the step-ups as needed to maintain the goal of the day.

**Scaling:**

♀ 20-inch box, **25-lb dumbbells**  
♂ 24-inch box, 35-lb dumbbells

For the handstand push-ups, you may reduce the reps to 3 and 6, respectively, so long as the strict handstand push-ups remain unbroken. If the volume of handstand push-ups is still too high, consider reducing the reps further or adding one or two AbMats under your head to reduce range of motion.

Goal: Conditioning + pulling endurance.

This is our homage to the Open and Quarterfinals coming soon! It's a bodyweight workout that can make you dizzy!

Last year, we faced single-under crossovers and burpee pull-ups. Today, we're combining these two movements with one that will interfere by adding a large range of motion hip flexion. There is no rest unless you've practiced your single-under crossovers.

Slow and steady wins the race. These movements take various times and rushing, especially on the crossovers, can cause unnecessary mistakes. There's no real rhythm in this workout so you'll need to adapt to the speed of execution of each movement. The burpee pull-ups will eat up a lot of time, but if you move efficiently, creating the same steps for each rep, you will find the rhythm. The GHD sit-ups will feel the most chaotic since it's a high-velocity movement, but we can control that by taking a quick breath at the top of each rep and controlling our descent with the help of gravity. To help with proper mechanics and prevent dizziness, keep your gaze neutral and focus on a point far away from you such as where the wall meets the ceiling.


**Scaling:**  

**Intermediate option:**  
Complete as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes of:  
**4 x [4 single-unders + 1 crossover]**  
10 burpee **jumping pull-ups**  
12 GHD sit-ups **to parallel**

The biggest sticking point in this workout is the technical demand of the crossovers. This is why we've split the work into short sets with one crossover at the end. If this is not a challenge, reduce the number of single-unders completed between crossovers until 20 total jumps have been accumulated. The pull-up bar should sit 2-3 inches below the wrists for the jumping pull-ups.

**Beginner option:**  
Complete as many rounds as possible in 20 minutes of:  
20 **single-unders**  
**6 up-down jumping pull-ups**  
12 **AbMat** sit-ups

Beginner athletes should start at a conservative pace. Approach this workout as you would a 5K run: You wouldn’t begin at a 400-meter sprint pace. Aim to keep the single-unders as smooth as possible; that’s your recovery time.

Jan Kozak, our newest addition to the team at [Deka Comp](https://cf.games/23_deka), gave us this one. Kozak has a love for barbell cycling and here are some of his notes: 

Pulling, cleaning, squatting — all the barbell fun in one good, clean rodeo. Athletes should attempt to go unbroken on the bar throughout, but it’s likely many will break the reps up late in the workout.

Fast in this triplet means efficient. You can’t rush this load if you struggle to have control over the basic elements of each movement: Bar path, upper-back engagement, and for the cleans, proper turnover mechanics. To set yourself up for success, move cleanly on the deadlifts (pun intended), be snappy when receiving the bar in the cleans, and keep your weight in your heels on the front squats.

**Intermediate option:**   
7 rounds for time:  
7 deadlifts  
7 hang power cleans  
7 front squats

**♀ 75 lb**  
**♂ 115 lb**

Intermediate athletes should focus on moving through the hang power cleans as efficiently as possible.

**Beginner option:**   
7 rounds for time:  
7 deadlifts  
7 hang power cleans  
7 front squats

**♀ 45 lb**  
**♂ 65 lb**

Beginners should focus on the setup position in the deadlift. Rather than aiming for unbroken reps, take strategic breaks to reset. A strategy could be to drop the bar on the sixth deadlift, then perform the last rep with the plan to go straight into the hang power cleans. Focus on a big jump and shrug in the hang power cleans — break around reps 4 or 5 if needed. Go for unbroken front squats if possible.

Read: “If” by Rudyard Kipling

If you can keep your head when all about you  
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!","https://www.crossfit.com/231112",20231112

Sadie Jane Huffer, 37, died on Feb. 17, 2023, when a roof collapsed in Anchorage, Alaska, at Turnagain CrossFit. 

Huffer was a beloved wife, mother, daughter, and friend. She was born in Spokane, Washington, and came to Anchorage to study at the University of Alaska. After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in social work, she went on to become a licensed clinical social worker.

Described by loved ones as sensitive, loving, and caring, Huffer enjoyed knitting, picking blueberries, making bread, smoking salmon, and working out at Turnagain CrossFit.

Huffer is survived by her husband, John Paul; children, Tyler, Blaise, and Jane; sisters, Sarah Ransom and Samantha Lamphier; and parents, Denise and Ted Smith.

A memorial workout event is being held by Huffer's Turnagain CrossFit family on April 8 at 7 p.m. at The Dome in Anchorage. To help Huffer's family during this time, you may donate [here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/dpt5a-help-the-victim).

Many in the CrossFit and medical communities are [mourning the loss of Dr. Sarah Hallberg](https://www.virtahealth.com/blog/remembering-dr-sarah-hallberg?mc_cid=23ec7f86e0&mc_eid=12d3b7243b), who passed away late last month following a long battle with lung cancer. 

Dr. Hallberg was a vanguard thinker in the fields of obesity and diabetes management and prevention. When Hallberg realized her training — first as an exercise physiologist and later as a primary care physician — had not equipped her to help her patients in the way she wanted, she didn’t give up. Instead, she worked harder to find a way to help.

After serving eight years in primary health care, Hallberg left her practice to dig into the scientific literature on obesity. Her research and passion opened onto a new career path for her, leading her to head an obesity study at Indiana University, deliver a [TED Talk at Purdue](https://blog.virtahealth.com/dr-sarah-hallberg-ted-talk-reversing-diabetes/), and become the Medical Director at [Virta Health](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/effectiveness-and-safety-of-a-novel-care-model-for-the-management-of-type-2-diabetes-at-1-year) before [joining the CrossFit Health circuit](https://www.crossfit.com/essentials/sarah-hallberg-ddc) to share her research on carb-restrictive diets in the treatment and reversal of Type 2 diabetes.

Hallberg was committed to finding effective, sustainable, and preventive measures for treating diabetes — alternatives to traditional methods involving insulin and other drugs. She focused on empowering physicians to do more than write prescriptions and helping patients take control of their health.

If you would like to help continue Hallberg’s work, please consider contributing to the [GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/dr-sarahs-legacy-t2-reversal?mc_cid=23ec7f86e0&mc_eid=12d3b7243b) organized by fellow CrossFit Health contributor Nina Teicholz.

Isabel is one of the fastest CrossFit benchmark workouts. Reduce the load so you can perform multiple reps unbroken and complete all the reps in less than 7 minutes. Athletes less familiar with Olympic lifting should take time to drill the mechanics of each movement and reduce the load drastically. Increasing the load, like in the video, may be appropriate for a few advanced athletes, but most should keep this lighter in order to finish quickly.

The CrossFit community mourns the loss of Chad Robert Peyton, a beloved husband, father, son, brother, and friend. Chad, a U.S. Army veteran with 10 years of military service, struggled with depression and anxiety. He took his own life on May 17, 2021.  

Chad received a Congressional nomination to attend West Point, where he graduated with a B.S. in May 2003 before being commissioned as an aviation officer in the U.S. Army.  

Chad became a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter pilot and served in Germany during Operation Iraqi Freedom II. He was subsequently promoted to Captain and stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, from 2006 until 2009, when he was transferred to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. During his military service, he was awarded the Bronze Star and many other awards and commendations.  

In 2012, Chad was honorably discharged from the Army and relocated to Santa Cruz, California, where he became a beloved member of the local CrossFit community. He and his wife, Nicole, were married in September 2014.  

When he wasn’t flying helicopters as a first responder, Chad enjoyed spending time with his family, doing CrossFit, hiking in the forest, surfing, traveling, and helping his friends and fellow veterans.  

Chad is survived by Nicole, who works on the publishing team at the CrossFit Home Office; his two children, Isla, 5, and Ellis, 3; and many other friends and family members.

**Scaling:**  
If choosing Test 1, modify the movements and reduce the dumbbell load to something you can perform quickly and unbroken. This workout is a sprint, and should be scaled to allow for a quick, all-out effort.  

If choosing Test 2, be careful of the high volume of each exercise, especially with the GHD. Athletes without exposure to the GHD should drastically reduce the volume. Overall this workout is fairly long, so choose modifications that are still challenging, and plan on having to break each exercise multiple sets.

Kerrie Orozco, 29, was killed in the line of duty on May 20, 2015. A seven-year veteran of the Omaha Police Department, Orozco was killed just hours before she was set to start maternity leave. Her daughter Olivia Ruth was born prematurely on Feb. 17, 2015, and Orozco had put off maternity leave until she could bring her daughter home from the hospital. 

Orozco is survived by her husband, Hector; two stepchildren, Natalie and Santiago; and baby Olivia.

She began CrossFit at CrossFit FitFarm and also worked out with fellow officers outside the affiliate. 

She exhibited a passion for community service that went beyond her police duties. She volunteered with the Special Olympics and was president of the Police Officers Ball to benefit Special Olympics Nebraska. She also coached baseball for the North Omaha Boys and Girls Club.

U.S. Marine Corps Corporal Larry D. Harris, Jr., 25, was killed in a fire fight on July 1, 2010, while serving as Fire Team Leader, 3d Squad, 81 Millimeter Mortar Platoon, Weapons Company, Third Battalion, First Marines, Regimental Combat Team 7, FIRST Marine Division (Forward), I MEF (Forward) in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.  

Harris was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for his bravery in action. As stated in his letter of commendation: “When the squad's machine gunner was shot in the leg, Corporal Harris immediately moved from his covered position while still under heavy fire, with complete disregard for his own safety ... . Corporal Harris unhesitatingly picked up the wounded Marine and carried him to the medical evacuation site, once again exposing himself to effective enemy fire from multiple directions. As he moved through a vineyard while carrying the wounded Marine, Corporal Harris struck an improvised explosive device, absorbing the majority of the explosion with his body. Although his injuries would prove fatal, Corporal Harris ultimately saved the life of the wounded Marine.”  

Harris is survived by his wife, Stacia Janice Harris, and his parents, Bruce and Lora Merriweather.","https://www.crossfit.com/201111",20201111

"Saturday 110910","Tabata ""Bottom to Bottom"" Squat  
Run 1 mile  
  
Clock starts for run on rising from last squat.  
  
The Tabata Bottom to Bottom Squat is a Tabata Squat but each rep begins at the bottom and ends at the bottom. The turn around at the top is immediate - no pause. The ten-second rest for each interval is also held at the bottom of the squat as opposed to the top. Interestingly, this squat, in contrast to the ""normal"" Tabata squat, motivates full hip extension. Also, the ten second rests don't seem as short with this protocol!

Run 1 mile  
  
Clock starts for run on rising from last squat.  
  
The Tabata Bottom to Bottom Squat is a Tabata Squat but each rep begins at the bottom and ends at the bottom. The turn around at the top is immediate - no pause. The ten-second rest for each interval is also held at the bottom of the squat as opposed to the top. Interestingly, this squat, in contrast to the ""normal"" Tabata squat, motivates full hip extension. Also, the ten second rests don't seem as short with this protocol!

"Saturday 100116","With a continuously running clock, squat for 60 seconds. Subtract the number of squats completed from 60, and do that many pull-ups in minute two. In minute three, squat again, subtracting the number completed from 60. Do that number of push-ups in minute four. Minute five is squatting again, and minute six pull-ups.  
  
The pattern is squats, pull-ups, squats, push-ups, squats, pull-ups, etc. The goal is to stay within the workout's formula for as long as possible.   
  
Don't do more than 60 squats in any round.

"Tuesday 051011","""**Fight Gone Bad!""**  
  
This is our famous ""Fight Gone Bad"" workout. It has been used extensively to prep fighters for the UFC. In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. We've used this in 3 and 5 round versions. Today is 3 rounds. The stations are:   
  
Wall-ball 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)   
Sumo deadlift high-pull 75 pounds (Reps)   
Box Jump 20"" box (Reps)   
Push-press 75 pounds (Reps)   
Row (Calories)   
  
The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of ""rotate"", the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point.   
  
Add your points and post them to comments.

In memory of Navy Lieutenant Michael Murphy, 29, of Patchogue, N.Y., who was killed in Afghanistan June 28th, 2005.   
  
This workout was one of Mike's favorites and he'd named it ""Body Armor"". From here on it will be referred to as ""Murph"" in honor of the focused warrior and great American who wanted nothing more in life than to serve this great country and the beautiful people who make it what it is.   
  
Partition the pull-ups, push-ups, and squats as needed. Start and finish with a mile run. If you've got a twenty pound vest or body armor, wear it.

"Tuesday 050412","**""Fight Gone Bad!""**  
  
This is our famous &#147;Fight Gone Bad&#148; workout. It has been used extensively to prep fighters for the UFC. In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. We&#146;ve used this in 3 and 5 round versions. Today is 3 rounds. The stations are:   
  
Wall-ball &#150; 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)   
Sumo deadlift high-pull 75 pounds (Reps)   
Box Jump &#150; 20&#148; box (Reps)   
Push-press 75 pounds (Reps)   
Row &#150; calories (Calories)   
  
The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of &#147;rotate&#148;, the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point.   
  
Add your points and post them to comments.

21-15-9 reps of:  
Deadlift 225  
Handstand push-ups  
  
This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management (work/rest timing to optimize time) is an essential skill.   
  
If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be ""your Diane.""

Set up before a clock, and every minute on the minute perform 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 squats. Can you continue for thirty minutes? Twenty minutes? How about 10? Post results to comments. If you fall behind the clock keep going for thirty minutes and see how many rounds you can complete.   
  
If you've finished the workout before, this time add +1 to each exercise, i.e., 6 pull-ups, 11 push-ups, and 16 squats each minute, and see if you can go the full thirty minutes.

21-15-9 reps of:  
Deadlift 225  
Handstand push-ups  
  
This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. It&#146;s expected that you&#146;ll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management &#150; work/rest timing to optimize time&#150; is an essential skill.   
  
If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there&#146;s a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics &#150; this will be &#147;your Diane.&#148;

This is our famous &#147;Fight Gone Bad&#148; workout. It has been used extensively to prep fighters for the UFC. In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. We&#146;ve used this in 3 and 5 round versions. Today is 3 rounds. The stations are:   
  
Wall-ball &#150; 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)   
Sumo deadlift high-pull 75 pounds (Reps)   
Box Jump &#150; 20&#148; box (Reps)   
Push-press 75 pounds (Reps)   
Row &#150; calories (Calories)   
  
The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of &#147;rotate&#148;, the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point.   
  
Add your points and post them to comments. 405 is the score to beat.

This is our famous ""Fight Gone Bad"" workout. It has been used extensively to prep fighters for the UFC. In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. We've used this in 3 and 5 round versions. Today is 3 rounds. The stations are:   
  
Wall-ball - 20 pound ball, 10 ft target. (Reps)   
Sumo deadlift high-pull 75 pounds (Reps)   
Box Jump - 20"" box (Reps)   
Push-press 75 pounds (Reps)   
Row (Calories)   
  
The clock does not reset or stop between exercises. On call of ""rotate,"" the athlete/s must move to next station immediately for good score. One point is given for each rep, except on the rower where each calorie is one point.   
  
Add your points and post them to comments. 405 is the score to beat.","https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2004/12/01",20041201

Run 1 mile  
  
Clock starts for run on rising from last squat.  
  
The Tabata Bottom to Bottom Squat is a Tabata Squat but each rep begins at the bottom and ends at the bottom. The turn around at the top is immediate - no pause. The ten-second rest for each interval is also held at the bottom of the squat as opposed to the top. Interestingly, this squat, in contrast to the ""normal"" Tabata squat, motivates full hip extension. Also, the ten second rests don't seem as short with this protocol!

Deadlift 225  
Handstand push-ups  
  
This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.   
  
If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be ""your Diane.""

The ""Short-rope"" jump is normal rope skipping done with a rope no longer than body length. You'll need to bring your knees high and swing your arms wide to get the rope beneath your feet. The extra work takes its toll. Only count reps that pass under without contacting your feet. (Thanks to HQ's Kevin Johnson)","https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2004/07/14",20040714

21-15-9 reps of:  
Deadlift 225  
Handstand push-ups  
  
This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. Compare your time to August 5, 2003 when we did a ""mini-Diane"" at 15-12-9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.   
  
If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be ""your Diane.""

For time:  
21-15- and 9 reps of:  
Deadlift 225  
Handstand Push-ups  
  
This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.   
  
If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be ""your Diane.""

21-15-9 reps of:  
Deadlift 225  
Handstand push-ups  
  
This is 3 rounds; the first at 21 reps, the second at 15, and the third at 9 reps. Compare your time to August 5, 2003 when we did a ""mini-Diane"" at 15-12-9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill.   
  
If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be ""your Diane.""

From the U.S. All-Round Weightlifting Association, [USAWA](http://www.usawa.com/rules.html#lifts ): “The lifter will have loaded onto his/her shoulders a weight equal to 150% of bodyweight. The lifter will then carry the weight a distance of one mile. Gait is optional. Resting is allowed, but neither the lifter nor the weight may be supported. Records will be kept in both pounds and time. Should the weight be touched by any aide once the lift has begun, the event is terminated. The lifter may be handed refreshments during the lift.”  
  
This is hard, and for many impossible. Start with 150% of bodyweight and see how far you can take it. Then, if not able to make the mile, rest and start again with largest load you estimate can be carried for a mile regardless of time.

Post total score from all three efforts in comments. E.G., 21+16+19=56.   
  
 There are three variations to our “wall ball” family of exercises. The first, or “[original](http://media.crossfit.com/cf-video/WallBall.wmv)”, familiar to all our regulars, is basically a front squat/push press combo that launches the ball towards the target. This move begins and ends in a squat. The second, or “overhead” throw is an overhead whole body throw. It begins with a powerful whole body arch sending the ball behind the head with the back and hips hyperextending, then the athlete hurls the ball forward and overhead towards the target. The third exercise, or “backwards” throw, is a reverse whole body throw in which the athlete turns his back to the target and drives the ball overhead and backwards towards the target.","https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2003/06/20",20030620

Our “thruster” is nothing more than a front squat - push press combo. The movement represents one of the most significant accelerations that can be performed by the human body. It requires a full range of motion in the ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, elbow, and wrist all working against the normal force of gravity with entire body mass plus a load. It doesn’t get any harder than that.","https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2003/05/05",20030505

The Tabata Bottom to Bottom Squat is a Tabata Squat but each rep begins at the bottom and ends at the bottom. The turn around at the top is immediate - no pause. The ten-second rest for each interval is also held at the bottom of the squat as opposed to the top. Interestingly, this squat, in contrast to the “normal” Tabata squat, motivates full hip extension.

the point of the workout take a LONG break after each couplet.

75 Sit-ups  
75 Kettlebell Swings, 1 ""pood"" kettlebell (16kg)  
150 Air Squats  
  
Perform the following in any order. The idea is to perform   
each in as few sets as possible. All of the reps from each   
exercise do not have to be completed before starting some   
from another exercise. Keep track of the reps and tally the   
total sets to completion. Note time to completion. Final score   
is total number of sets multiplied by time in minutes to completion.  
  
Notes:   
  
1. One possible approach is to perform a near max set of   
push-ups, go on to the pull-ups, do the same with the   
sit-ups, etc. After the squats, go back to the push-ups and   
run through the list again finishing as much as you can at each exercise.

"Friday 010720","One Muscle-up per minute for as long as you can go!  
  
Can anyone do one muscle-up per minute for twenty minutes?  
How far can you get?  
  
Note:  
1. A muscle-up is pulling yourself from below the rings to above and   
dipping to full arm extension. It is an unrivaled move for developing   
upper body strength.   
 It is much more difficult than any pull-up or dip and consequently a   
move of much greater potential for strength development.   
2. If you don't have rings, buy them!! Rings have no rival for upper   
body strength development. If you are serious about your sport/fitness   
you'll pick some up.  
3. We've listed some vendors within the message board.  
4. If you can't do a muscle up, see how many pull-ups and dips can   
you do in an hour?","https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2001/07/20",20010720

1) Hanging from the pull-up bar SLOWLY lean back and lift your feet towards your   
hands until your tows gently touch the bar. Repeat for a total of twenty times.  
2) Arch rock for one minute. If you've forgotten what the arch rock is go to: [http://www.audiblefaith.com/artists/rharrell/gympag/condstr.html](http://www.audiblefaith.com/artists/rharrell/gympag/condstr.html)

3) Fifty sit-ups with substantial support (towel or abmat, etc.) under the lumbar spine.   
Knees up and apart, feet together.  
4) Thirty back extensions.   
5) Hollow Rocks for sixty seconds. Again if you've forgotten: [http://www.audiblefaith.com/artists/rharrell/gympag/condstr.html](http://www.audiblefaith.com/artists/rharrell/gympag/condstr.html)  
6) 20 Stiff legged deadlifts. These are performed with an arched back! From the stand,   
bow down letting the chest lag behind as far as possible. Do not surrender the arch in   
your lower back. Done right you won't get anywhere near the floor with the barbell. If   
your mechanics are correct you will feel an extraordinary tightness in the hamstrings.  
7) Hold an L for sixty seconds. Repeat two times for a total of three efforts.

"Thursday 010308","Today we are employing a drill the CrossFit crew calls the “wall-ball.” The wall-ball drill is   
a deep front squat followed through with a push-press and overhead throw. The ball, a   
20 lb Dynamax medicine ball should make contact with the wall at about two feet over your   
reach and rebound to your hands where you immediately bring the ball back to your chest   
and squat to absorb the impact. The movements up and down are mechanically identical.   
Stand about 18 inches away from the wall. The idea is to be in constant motion either on   
the way up or catching and lowering. The major faults here are either to not squat to   
parallel and to let the ball contact with a thud rather than gently absorbing the impact with   
the arms and legs.

"Friday 010302","We are ready for a break from the neurological and orthopedic stresses of   
weightlifting and hard and heavy leg work.   
  
Here is an interval that the NSCA identifies as being smack dab in the middle   
of the lactic acid metabolic pathway. Remember one of the advantages of   
interval training is that we get extended exposure to cardiovascular work   
without the muscle wasting consistent with extended aerobic work.   
  
On the Concept II Rower set up for intervals and go all out for 60 seconds  
Row easy for two minutes.  
Repeat for a total of fifteen efforts.   
  
This is a total of forty-five minutes, yet the work is designed to enhance anaerobic   
capacity. Now here’s the really cool part: even though this work is predominantly   
anaerobic (lactic acid pathway), it carries a heavy aerobic benefit without the   
disadvantages of reducing speed, power, and strength known to accompany   
aerobic training.   
  
On setup scroll the display to show meters in the lower window. On your first   
effort throw as many meters up in the minute as you can. On the subsequent   
fifteen efforts fight for as much of the first distance as you can.   
  
On completion use recall to scroll through all fifteen intervals and record and   
submit the meters rowed for each interval.

"Tuesday 010227","We are due for a little circuit work. Circuit training is an excellent test   
of your overall fitness. At CrossFit intensities it becomes debilitating.   
We use it sparingly and go all out! This is ""combat"" or ""getting out of   
the burning building"" fitness.   
  
Decide loads and assistance (if absolutely necessary to get ALL reps)   
before starting. Be smart, shelve your ego and shoot for rapid completion   
with NO rest. Submit record of total time, weights for each lift, and   
assistance (if needed on pull-ups and dips). Set up recording sheet   
ahead of time. Rip!!

How many pull-ups can you do in an hour?  
  
Success comes here by pacing and not going to failure on any set.   
Rankings will be by weight class.  
  
Don't be foolish and fill in with any met-con (cardio) or other work.   
You don't know what looms! Also, if you're current with the path   
the other athletes have been following and your intensity has been   
worthy of your best efforts you are long overdue for a reduced   
metabolic load.  
  
Our ""Workout of the Day"" is engineered with great dilligence to care for   
ALL of your fitness needs. If some days seem too easy that is because   
workouts either before or coming are tortuous and the backing off is   
warranted. We are feeding you a regimen that represents the ultimate   
challenge for the world's best athletes.  
  
If you are concurrently training for sport, like most of our athletes, temper   
your efforts to allow for successful sport training. This is a learned skill   
requiring a finely honed sense of self. On the days when your sports   
training regimen is lighter, tear it up with our strength and conditioning   
workout. On days when your sports training regimen is tough, moderate   
your efforts. Many of our athletes are able to engage the ""Workout of the Day""   
right up to and during competition by just ""going through the motions"" while   
still ""doing"" the daily workout.  
  
Again, the ""Workout of the Day"" is designed to accomodate additional sport   
training, recreational activity, or stand alone by simply modulating the intensity   
of your effort. If you need help with this concept email at feedback@crossfit.com   
and one of our coaches will gladly help you come to terms with this.","https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2001/02/26",20010226
"Sunday 010225","1) Bike 20 minutes at a warm-up pace.  
We are doing three sets of back squats at twenty-one reps each.   
Choose a weight that you feel you can handle comfortably for   
twenty-one reps of regular back squats. These specialized movements   
are tough! Make damned sure you warm-up thoroughly with ""air squats""   
and stretching first.   
2) ""Power squat"":  
Lower and rise as quickly as you can while maintaining PERFECT form.   
Repeat 20 times.  
3) ""Bottom to bottom"":   
Lower to full squat position (thighs parallel to floor), hold for a full ten   
seconds, rise and immediately upon full extension of hip and leg return to   
bottom and hold for ten seconds. Repeat 20 times.  
4) ""Super slow"":   
Take twenty seconds to reach bottom and twenty seconds to reach top   
again. Repeat 20 times.   
5) Finally, how long can you maintain a 2:00 min. 500-meter pace average?   
Set the rower for ""Avg 500 meter pace"" and stop and record the time at the

Though the ""Workout of the Day"" is designed to meet the needs of elite athletes   
readying for the highest levels of competition, they can be toned down to provide   
an acceptable challenge for even the novice exerciser. Choose lighter loads,   
reduce reps, slow the pace, and substitute one pulling, pushing, or leg exercise   
for tamer versions of the same function. If you need help or ideas for moderating   
these workouts let us know by email at feedback@crossfit.com  
  
The ""Workout of the Day"" is engineered to elicit an adaptive response consistent   
with the CrossFit philosopy (see CrossFit Foundations).   
  
Following the workout daily provides a substantial volume of exercise at HIGH   
intensity while minimizing the likliehood of burnout and overtraining or orthopedic   
over-stress. Considerable thought and energy has been given to the precise order   
and nature of the workouts. Alterations of this pattern potentially risks burnout,   
injury, or gaps in your fitness.","https://www.crossfit.com/workout/2001/02/24",20010224
